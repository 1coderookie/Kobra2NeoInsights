# Introduction
Anycubic decided to not make the Marlin-based source code files available yet.  
Therefore it's not possible at this time to have a look at files like the `Configuration.h` and check specific settings or to get the according pin assignment out of it which one would neeed to create a specific `printer.cfg`for a Klipper installation.   
So at this time I can't provide any insights about specific Marlin settings or about how to install Klipper on these machines.  
Once there were successful attempts of installing [Klipper](fw_klipper.md), you can find the information I then hopefully came across in the specific section.
