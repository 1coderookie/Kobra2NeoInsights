# Printer

The Kobra 2 Neo comes partially pre-assembled, you only have to mount a few parts like the 'upstanding' z-axis frame onto the base frame.  
  
See [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) to find manuals, test files and the suggested parameters profiles for this machine.    

The following pictures show the machine.

*Note: I didn't attach the filament spool holder to the left side of the machine as it should be done when taking these pictures for being able to put both pictures between each other in a decent size here.*
