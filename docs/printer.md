# Printer
The Anycubic [Kobra 2 Neo](https://www.anycubic.com/products/kobra-2-neo) is an entry-level bedslinger FDM printer which is advertised as being capable to print at 150mm/s speed (up to 250mm/s max).  
  
The Kobra 2 Neo comes partially pre-assembled, you only have to mount a few parts like the 'upstanding' z-axis frame onto the base frame.  
  
See [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) to find manuals, test files and the suggested parameters profiles for this machine.

*Note: I didn't attach the filament spool holder to the left side of the machine as it should be done when taking these pictures for being able to put both pictures between each other in a decent size here.*

## Box Content

The printer comes partially preassembled and well packed in one big box.  
As I don't have a picture of the Kobra 2 Neo how it arrives in the box, I'll show you a picture of the Kobra 2 Pro instead as the content will be basically somewhat the same.

Along with the printer come some additional parts, like a sample of PLA, a microSD card reader, some tools, a spare nozzle and so on. You can see these items in the following picture.
