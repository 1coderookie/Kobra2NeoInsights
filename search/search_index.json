Besides those steps being mentioned in the section \"Other Calibration\" (yet), you also have to do other calibrations as well for e.g. finding the correct printing temperature for your specific filament and so on. There are many websites and YouTube guides out there to find which are already covering this wide topic of calibrations and give way more detailed instructions for certain calibrations though, so I'd recommend to do a little research by your own.

One of the great functions is, that SuperSlicer already comes with an inbuilt set of calibration tools.    You'll follow the proposed order and generate the specific 3d models for your specific needs with just one click, like temperature towers, retraction towers and so on.

Means, slowly move the bed and the printhead manually across the whole range of motion and turn the lead screw by hand (across the whole range of motion as well) and check if you feel any unusual resistance in certain areas. alter the movement speeds then and see if everything still feels well.    Parts being attached to the axes and running along them like the printhead and the bed shouldn't wiggle as well (never mind the top of the z-axis lead screw though - it's fine that it might wiggle a bit, as it isn't and shouldn't be fixated at the top).   When everything looks and feels good, you can move the bed, the printhead and the position of the x-axis gantry to about the middle of the range of motion, then turn on the printer and home all axes using the control unit to see if the endstops are working.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"calibration/#tram-the-bed","title":"Tram The Bed","text":"<p>Even though 'tramming the bed' (aka 'leveling' the bed) isn't really possible when using the rigid stock spacers of the bedplate these printers come with, there is something one can and should do though: check if those spacers are all of the same height.

In the firmware there should be the setting <code>#define ENABLE_LEVELING_AFTER_G28</code>, which activates the ABL after G28 (homing) was called. This will load the specific mesh values from the printer's EEPROM and activate the function of the ABL, so that minor height variations of the bed's surface will be compensated while printing. So if that's present, then there should be no need to add the <code>M420 S1</code> command. As a matter of fact, adding it might even cause irregularities.

And even then it might occur that you'll have to adjust certain settings later when finally printing 'real' models. So maybe try to see it more like a process instead of the struggle of a search for the 'perfect' settings which must out there somewhere..  </p> <p>Also keep in mind that you'll have to do certain calibrations again when using different kinds of filament. This doesn't only comes into account when printing a differenty type like ABS or PETG instead of PLA, but it also most likely will be the case when using the same type of filament but made from another manufaturer. Even the same type and brand of filament from the same manufacturer might need some slightly different settings like the temperature for example, when you're using a new spool or a different colour!  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#z-offset","title":"Z-Offset","text":"<p>The z-offset is the distance between the nozzle and the bed/plate you're printing on. It comes into account when printing the first layer of a model and therefore it's crucial and absolutely important that you dial in your z-offset to get your first layer as perfect as possible. If the nozzle is too far up above the plate, you'll experience that the print doesn't stay onto the bed or (if it's way too far up) that it'll just produce 'spaghetti' while printing up in the air. If it's too close to the plate and therefore the filament will be squished into the plate too much, then it'll either be difficult to remove the object or (if the nozzle is way too close) it'll provoke clogging as the filament won't be able to come out of the nozzle. Worst case would be that the nozzle scrapes across the plate and that you damage the hardware itself.  </p> <p>Even though the z-offset will be somewhat calculated by the printer itself by probing the z-offset switch, you might need to finetune the setting on the fly while printing an inital layer of a model. The perfect z-offset can also change when using different types of filament, means, you might have to adjust it when using e.g. PETG instead of PLA.  </p> <p>To determine the perfect first layer, I'd recommend to have a look at this handy guide from Billie Ruben first to get an impression how you can judge if the first layer (and therefore the z-offset) is good or not and how it should look like. </p> <p>After initiating the probing and calibration sequence using the control unit, start a print job and verify that the first layer came out perfect. Compare the look of it with the abovementioned poster from Billie Ruben to check if it really is perfect or if you need a bit of adjustment. If you need to adjust the height, you don't need to execute an ABL sequence again, just correct the z-offset setting. You can also adjust it 'on the fly' using the control unit while printing a (larger) first layer and look at the outcome - this is often even better as you'll see the effect right away.    </p> Don't Rely On The \"Paper Method\" <p>Using the abovementioned feeler gauge or a sheet of paper (which people usually recommend - using a feeler gauge is more precise though) for dialing in your z-offset is only an approach to get in the right area of your z-offset. The optimal z-offset for printing a perfect first layer depends on various factors like e.g. layer height and type of filament being used. So always check the first layer while printing it and dial in your z-offset on the fly while printing it.   </p> Print A Skirt <p>I personally recommend adding a skirt to the models you're printing. You activate that setting in your slicer, there you can also determine the width of the skirt and the distance to the model. When printing a skirt you print a few lines outside the area the model will be printed. This serves as a purge line (I personally don't use a purge line because I use a skirt) and you can check if the z-offset is set correctly. If not, you can adjust in on the fly. You could also add a brim in addition to a skirt or even instead of a skirt - a brim is connected to the model though (which helps keeping the model stuck on the bed) which isn't always wanted.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#printing-temperature-filament","title":"Printing Temperature (Filament)","text":"<p>You determie the best printing temperature for your specific type of filament by printing temperature towers. These models change the printing temperature at certain layer heights in certain steps (e.g. in 5\u00b0C increments, starting with the highest temperature first), so that you'll print the same structure with different temperatures. For generating a temperature tower with your own specific settings, I recommend using the abovementioned SuperSlicer with the inbuilt calibration toolset. You can take the recommendations of the manufacturer of your filament as a rough guide for the temperature range you should print at.   </p> <p>Then you inspect the printed model: in which temperature zones does it look best? Where are the layers of the filament solidified and melted together best? Where do overhangs look best and where does (massive) oozing and stringing occur?  Don't pay too much attention on stringing and oozing yet though, as you'll take care of that later by printing retraction towers. Same goes for bridges (and overhangs): if you notice that bridges didn't come out perfect and that you can see strings of filament 'hanging' down, don't get too irritated by that as well. You can and should take care of bridging specific settings in your slicer later anyway, like a different printing speed, different extrusion rate, different fan speed and so on.    </p> <p>What's actually more important at this time right now is the bonding of the layers! You can encounter an already pretty much great looking print with lower temperatures, but the model will break apart between layers easily. Vice versa you can observe that some stringing, oozing and/or maybe some poorer bridging quality will occur at higher temperatures, but the bonding is much better! As you'll take care of settings that affect stringing and bridging later anyway, I'd recommend to always go with the higher temperature when in doubt!  Besides only looking at the outcome, I personally use to tear apart the printed temperature towers. By doing so, you can find the best printing temperature - not only in terms of the 'look', but also in terms of mechanical stress and resistance. So try to break each temperature section apart by using your hands first. You'll most likely already encounter some floors which are easy to break apart. Once you're done with that, take two pliers and repeat the process for each floor. You'll most likely be able to break every floor at a certain point, but you'll notice some obvious differences like how much force you have to use and how the floors break apart. So after you teared the model apart, inspect those areas: did it clearly break right between two layers? Or did it break across different layers? When it clearly broke between two layers, inspect the next floor with the higher temperature being used. Try to find the floor where it seems that the layers sticked together very well and the break most likely occured across different layers.    </p> <p>Once you're done and decided to go with a specific temperature, continue with other calibrations like printing retraction towers, calibrating the e-steps and so on. At the end I'd recommend to print another temperature tower once again for being able to compare the output to the first one you printed. You don't have to print such a 'large' and wide ranged temperature tower though, maybe just print a tower with the 'final' settings and temperature you decided to use and add a floor with 5\u00b0 higher and 5\u00b0 lower temperature.   </p> <p>Slightly Lower Temperatures Seem To Be Reported</p> <p>I'd like to mention a finding I made after switching to the Klipper firmware instead of the stock firmware. In the stock firmware the type of temperature sensor for the hotend is set as an \"ATC Semitec\" type (see the chapter \"Stock Firmware (Marlin Based)\" for further information). After switching to Klipper, I set different sensor types and inspected the reported temperature. It turned out that with the setting \"Generic 3950\" the reported temperature seemed to be more accurate than with the \"ATC Semitec\" type of sensor being set in the stock firmware, which seems to report slightly lower temperatures than actually being present at the hotend.  Even though this doesn't really affect the usage at the end, as you'll determine the best printing temperature by the abovementioned outcome in terms of look and bonding quality anyway instead of judging by the sheer temperature value, it is something you should keep in the back of your mind though.  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#retraction-settings","title":"Retraction Settings","text":"<p>As a crucial element for great printing results you need to find the optimum settings for retraction distance and retraction speed. Both settings have to be evaluated for each filament you're using. You'll note that the settings may differ not only within the same type of material, but especially within different types of material (when printing PLA for example you'll end up with pretty different settings than you'll use when printing flexible TPU). In general you'll determine the correct settings (after determining the correct print temperature) by printing retraction distance and retraction speed towers. Slight adjustments might be necessary later on though, so pay attention to not only the stringing, but also to e.g. starts and ends of layers where over-/underextrusion might be occur due to imperfect retraction settings.   </p> <p>The correct settings will mostly avoid stringing. There are various aspects which affect stringing though, so if you struggle with stringing, you might want to have a look at the section \"Stringing\" where I list some factors that affect it. </p> <p>Feeder Gear Pressure Is Crucial!</p> <p>It should be noted that the correct pressure of the feeder gear is very crucial (not only) when it comes down to retracting. If the feeder gear pressure is too low, the gear won't 'grab' the filament sufficiently and therefore starts slipping and grinding instead of pulling it back. If the pressure is too high though, it'll deform the filament which may result in e.g. visible artefacts of your printed model. So make sure you adjusted the correct pressure.  You can check if the filament gets properly fed and retracted by looking at the filament while printing. Adding some marks with a water resistant pen might be helpful. Observe the filament if it gets retracted (= pushed back) and fed reliably when the printer should do so.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#retraction-distance","title":"Retraction Distance","text":"<p>The retraction distance is a crucial setting one has to take care about. The retraction distance is the setting how far the feeder gear will pull back the filament when retracting.      </p> <p>Finding the correct retraction distance setting can be difficult and might take a few iterations, as it depends on various other settings and variables, so there isn't a general one-fits-all setting one could use.  </p> <p>As this is a direct drive system, you need to go with small retraction distance settings. Due to the Volcano-like nozzle and the longer melting zone, you can try up to 2mm and still should be safe (imho). Start with the smallest settings though!</p> <p>For finding out the correct retraction distance setting, you can print retraction distance towers, where different retraction distance values are applied at certain heights (kinda the same like when printing temperature towers). Before doing so, you should have figured out the correct printing temperature though.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#retraction-speed","title":"Retraction Speed","text":"<p>Retraction speed is the setting how fast the feeder gear will pull back the filament when retracting. It plays together with the setting of the retraction distance, and both settings affect each other. In general it seems that you can say that the higher the speed, the lower the distance can be - but like with every 'rule of thumb', this is just a 'rough' guide and you'll need to find out the optimum setting for your specific setup by your own. You might also find out that things work out much better and that you get better results when using a lower retraction speed.    </p> <p>It has to be mentioned though that a high(er) retraction speed isn't always the key - it can also be the case that using a lower speed is necessary for getting the best results. This also depends on the type and quality of the filament as well.  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#calibrating-e-steps","title":"Calibrating E-Steps","text":"<p>You've probably already came along the sentence \"calibrate your e-steps\" and maybe you wonder what it is, what you'd have to do and why you should do so. It's actually pretty simple: the \"e-steps\" are the steps of the motor of your extruder (so \"e-steps\" stands for \"extruder-steps\") and therefore they determine how much filament will be extruded with a certain amount of motor steps. Depending on how accurate this setting is (means, how well you calibrated the e-steps), you'll either have some pretty perfect prints (in the meaning of the amount of filament of each layer) or you'll see signs of more or less severe under- or overextrusion. Some people try to adjust or get rid of this problem by setting different extrusion multipliers in the slicer, but that's not the best/correct way (imho). You always should have the hardware tuned in as much as possible before trying to tweak software settings for better results.   </p> <p>Even though the e-steps don't seem to be way off when it comes from the manufacturer with the default firmware settings, it's advisable to calibrate them. This whole procedure really isn't a big deal and doesn't take long, so make sure to do this calibration!   </p> <p>However, you need an additional software like OctoPrint or Pronterface for being able to send the specific g-code commands to the printer. As you most likely don't have that installed yet when you just started with 3d printing, I'm mentioning this calibration not as one of the first things to do, even though one should do it as soon and early as possible, as it effects the outcome overall.   </p> <p>The actual process of how to calibrate the e-steps is described in many articles see the abovementioned and videos already, so right now I won't go into the final details here. Please see the links in the section \"Calibration Guides\" above.   </p> <p>So, basically what you'll do is measure e.g. 100mm and 120mm of filament right above the printhead where the filament enters and mark those two spots. Then you heat up your system to your regular printing temperature, extrude 100mm and measure the distance between the printhead (where the filament enters) and the 100mm and 120mm marks once the extrusion is done. If e.g. the 100mm mark is right at the spot where the filament enters - great, no calibration necessary! But if either more or less than the 100mm got extruded, then you'd have to do a little math using a formula and the measured values of the distance to the marks for determining the final value of the e-steps. The calculated value has to be set and saved to the firmware then. After doing so, repeat this process for verifying that the new setting is correct.  </p> <p>Some guides say that you should do it without a nozzle, some guides say you should do it with the nozzle. I personally found it most precise when doing the calibration using the final print setup, so these are my personal suggestions when it comes down to execute this procedure:  </p> <ul> <li>Determine the correct printing temperature for the filament you're using.   </li> <li>Use the nozzle you're going to use for printing as well - so don't calibrate the e-steps with e.g. a 0.4mm nozzle, when you're printing with a 0.6mm nozzle later. </li> <li>Make sure the pressure of the feeder gear is correct and it's (mostly) the setting you'll use later on as well. So don't calibrate with a sloppy feeder gear and crank up the tension later and vice versa. </li> <li>Make sure to use a fine lined, waterproof pen for marking the filament, so don't use a fat marker which aleady draws a 1mm or 2mm wide line! You want to be as precise as possible here! </li> <li>Make sure to use a precise ruler or a sliding gauge for being able to actually really measure 100mm! You'd be suprised how bad certain measurement tools actually are and how big deviations can actually be, so make sure to use a sufficient measuring tool.  </li> <li>Calibrate the e-steps whenever you use different type of filament, even different spools of the same type. The process doesn't take long, but it's crucial that the e-steps are calibrated. So better take the little time to check if everything is still fine after changing the filament.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"calibration/#pid-tuning","title":"PID Tuning","text":"<p>Without going into too much details here, PID stands for Proportion, Integral and Derivate. These are three variables of an algorith which is supposed to keep the temperature stable. By executing a PID tuning, the printer heats up the desired heating element (extruder or bed) to a given temperature, cools down again a few degrees and heats up again for a given amount of circles and measures the fluctuation. After the process is done, you'll then get an output of three values P, I and D and save them to the firmware.  </p> <p>It's advisable to execute a PID tuning for both the extruder and the bed before you want to use your printer for the first time. Also after you changed something at the hotend (like installed a new nozzle or heatbreak) and especially if you changed the cartridge heater or a thermistor (or even the position of it when removing and reinserting it) or installed a new bed, you should execute a PID tuning.  </p> <p>The best way to execute a PID tuning is by simply using certain G-code commands and send them to your printer. To do so, I'll show you an example of how to do it using OctoPrint - but you can do it with any other program that allows you to send G-code commands directly also.  </p> <p>PID tuning needs to be done in two steps: one for the extruder and one for the bed.  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#extruder-pid-tuning","title":"Extruder PID Tuning","text":"<p>Because I use to print at 220\u00b0C, I want to use this temperature for the PID tuning of the extruder. I want the printer to execute seven cycles - the more the better the result will be.  </p> <p>The belonging G-code is <code>M303 E0 S220 C7</code> where <code>M303</code> is the PID tune, <code>E0</code> is the extruder, <code>S220</code> is the temperature of 220\u00b0C and <code>C7</code> means seven cycles.  </p> Turn On The Part Cooling Fan Beforehand <p>It's advisable to turn on the part cooling fan before doing the PID tuning for the hotend to take a possible effect of it into account. If you do so, it might be smart to use the fan speed you're going to use later for printing - by doing so, you could also create PID tuning values for different types of filament which require a different fan speed, like PLA, PETG, TPU and so on and add the specific values to the start g-code of your slicer's profiles for these specific types of filament.   </p> <p>The following command turns on the part cooling fan with the fan speed of 100%: <code>M106 E0 S255</code> The value 255 means 255 PWM cycles, which is 100% fan speed. If you want to run the fan at a different fan speed, like 50% for example, you have to calculate the belonging binary value you have to use (instead of 255) by multiplying the desired speed value by 2.55. So as an example: let's assume you want to run the fan at 50% as you use to run the part cooling fan at 50% when printing PETG. Therefore you want to do the PID tuning with the part cooling fan running at 50% as well. Now calculate 50*2.55=127.5 which is then rounded up to 128 - which then is the binary value you need to use: <code>M106 E0 S128</code> = the part cooling fan runs at 50% fan speed for the PID tuning.   </p> <p>After sending this command, the printer will reply and start the process: <pre><code>Send: M303 E0 S220 C7  \nRecv: PID Autotune start\n</code></pre></p> <p>The printer will then display the process and values for each cycle.

The RPi is a little computer which became pretty famous since it entered the market. It's a Broadcom SoC 64bit ARM system with LAN (and WiFi within the newer versions) and a microSD card reader onboard which keeps the desired OS. It offers GPIOs to directly connect hardware like sensors to it and it draws only a little amount of power. Pretty much all of the regular software for 3D printing like the beforementioned OctoPrint or Mainsail or so are available as specific RPi image which makes it pretty easy and flawless to install even if you're not an expert. Just install the Raspberry Pi Imager, create the specific image, copy it to a sufficient microSD card and you're good to go - the installation will take a few minutes only. And as handy as it is - it might not be the best solution, especially these days.  </p> <p>Prices for the RPi went up to a ridiculous level (afaik at least in Europe and the US) - if they're even available at all. Also you don't want to get yourself an old RPi2B for example, it should be a RPi3B at least (referring to OctoPrint a RPi Zero 2W also works, it uses the same Broadcom SoC like the RPi3) - a RPi4 would be even better and advisable. Not only because of the pure processor power or the RAM - both is sufficient even with the RPi3 for example, but mostly because of the reason how the USB sockets are connected to the CPU. Afaik, up until the RPi3 the Broadcom BCM2837 only offers one USB port itself. This one port is split up by using a SMSC LAN9514 hub chip to get four USB connectors out of it and it also uses the LAN port.  </p> <p>If you're asking yourself now \"What the heck is this guy talking about - I have four USB connectors available there, so what's the problem?\" - well, let me try to explain it to you very simple: Imagine you connect your RPi3 to a monitor and plug in a mouse, keyboard, your 3D printer and a webcam to the USB sockets and maybe you also use the LAN connection (because everybody who knows wireless uses wires ;) ). Then you start your printing process sending the gcode file to the printer and start to observe the printing process using the camera. Then all of the information are running across the same one and only USB port of the SoC (the main CPU). That means that most likely you'll find yourself noticing some kind of stuttering during the printing process and/or the stream of the webcam. That doesn't occur because of a lack of RAM or CPU power (what people use to assume) - that occurs because of the architecture and the bottleneck \"one USB port at the SoC\". So you can see it like a four lane street going down to one lane - as soon as there's (much) traffic on all of those four lanes, you'll get stuck in the traffic where it goes down to one lane.  </p> <p>So does that mean you shouldn't use a RPi? No, not at all, it works absolutely fine - just be aware of the fact that it might not be the best solution for your money during these times where they became pretty expensive.  </p> Looking For A Raspberry Pi? <p>If you're trying to find a RPi and have a hard time finding a company who actually has one in stock, maybe give the page rpilocator a try. It lists vendors and different RPi models and shows if there are RPis in stock.   </p> RPi Plus Touchscreen <p>If you're using a RPi, you can add a touchscreen to it and install an additional software like OctoDash which gives you a nice clean UI for OctoPrint optimized for small screens. It allows you to display certain status information and makes it possible to interact with OctoPrint directly using the touchscreen. Especially when you're using the Klipper firmware instead of the stock firmware, this is a great solution to still be able to monitor and control your printer while you're sitting in front of it as the regular control unit of your printer doesn't work with Klipper anymore. In this case I'd recommend to check out KlipperScreen.  </p> RPi Plus (Web-)Cam <p>However, if you're already running a RPi(3) and face those kind of problems as mentioned above which may be caused by a connected webcam to the RPi, I'd suggest the following:  </p> <ul> <li>Switch to a cheap/old type of webcam which only offers a low resolution like 480p (640x480). You don't need 4K to see what's going on and by using a low resolution you can at least decrease the amount of information that has to run through the mentioned bottleneck.  </li> <li>Don't create a time lapse video as it really is consuming a lot of processor power and RAM.</li> <li>Get rid of the USB cam and set up an IP cam (WiFi/LAN) instead which isn't connected to the RPi. Up to me this is even a better solution then downgrading the webcam as the RPi doesn't have to deal with the data from the IP cam at all. If you like to tinker and don't mind the probable effort, get yourself one of those cheap ESP32-CAM modules and set it up. Or just go for a cheap WiFi/LAN camera.   </li> <li>If you're already using a RPi\u00be with a RPi cam and don't have a sufficient housing for that yet, have a look at the thing from A_Leh: Anycubic Vyper/ Kobra Raspberry 4b (+3b) housing with camera attachment</li> <li>Last but not least: make sure you're using a good and fast microSD card and a good USB cable which connects the RPi to the printer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"printserver/#rpi-zero-2-w","title":"RPi Zero (2) W","text":"<p>Instead of using the regular Raspberry Pi, you could also get yourself the RPi Zero (2) W.

It might not really come into account if your prints last only a few hours and after finishing them you turn everything off. But as soon as you think about running those machines pretty much 24/7 you should keep in mind that they might draw a lot of power which sums up at the end.

Ok, might be a bit exxagerated, but I really love those fellas. Especially if you want a host for running Klipper on, Thin Clients are my number one recommendation.</p> <p>If you've never heard of them, let me give you a quick introduction: Thin Clients are computers which are often used by companies for e.g. setting up workstations for their employees or to have some kind of information desk or screen running somewhere. They have a small build factor, don't draw an excessive amount of power and usually come with connectors for LAN, USB, a monitor and so on. Especially newer models (like only a few years old) have hardware built in which would be even powerful enough to replace your daily driver for surfing the web, watching videos, writing stuff and so on. Generally speaking: the newer and bigger they are, the more they have to offer usually - I'm talking about energy efficient quadcore CPUs here and the possibility to put in up to 32GB or even 64GB of RAM, swapping in a SSD (2.5\", m2.SATA or m2.NVMe - that often depends on the age actually) and even run virtual machines (tip: ProxmoxVE) or containers (tip: Docker). Of course you could also just install a LinuxOS like Ubuntu or a headless Ubuntu Server and install your desired software directly there.  </p> <p>The (imho great) point is: you can get a pretty powerful and energy efficient machine which is a true x86 platform for just a little amount of money as companies use to sell them pretty cheap most of the time. You probably have to look out for a certain model a bit longer sometimes as they use to be sold out quite fast, but it would be worth it. Anyway - even if they're usually available for a fair price, I want to mention that it's advisable to not buy the very first offer you can find. Even though they're still cheap most of the times compared to a RPi4 for example, certain companies know about the potential and that people like to use them for tinkering around, so some companies call for much higher prices than others.  </p> Tips About Thin Clients <ul> <li>There are many different Thin Clients from different manufacturers available out there - a good site I'd like to recommend to gather around and check out the specs of different Thin Clients is ParkyTowers.  </li> <li>If you're looking for something really small, maybe look out for a Dell Wyse 3040 or 3020. They do have limited power and RAM possibilities compared to bigger Thin Clients, but for just acting as a headless print server instead of a RPi they're powerful enough.   </li> <li>I personally like the HP Thin Client T6x0 series as you can upgrade them really well. The higer the number, the newer the model and the more powerful, energy efficient and compatible with modern parts it is (e.g. T610 uses a 2.5\" SSD &amp; DDR3 SO-DIMM RAM while the T630 uses a m2.SATA SSD &amp; DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM).    </li> </ul>"},{"location":"printserver/#nas-server","title":"NAS / Server","text":"<p>If you have a NAS or a server up and running already, you could also install the printing software onto that.

I personally would not recommend it as a host for Klipper though - you can use an old Android device as a KlipperScreen though.  </p> <p>I won't go deeper here though due to my lack of experience with this solution - you'll find many information about this around the web. One of those sources of information I'd like to mention though is the video of Thomas Sanladerer: How to run OctoPrint on your phone! and the GitHub repository of feelfreelinux: octo4a.  </p> <p>Besides the possibilty to use your old android device as a printserver, you can also use it as an additional screen for software like OctoPrint. That means that you don't install e.g. OctoPrint itself on the android device - you install an app which connects with the running instance of OctoPrint and gives you a nice UI on your smartphone. By doing so you could mount your old phone at the printer and interact with OctoPrint using your touchscreen or just have certain information displayed at the screen.  </p> <p>However, it should be mentioned here that it seems to be a bit like gambling to find the right device which connects with the USB chip being used at the printers mainboard and that can be charged parallel to being connected to the printer as well. It might even occur that the mainboard might get affected somehow if one applies 5V to it through the USB-C connector. </p> KlipperScreen On An Old Android Device <p>Especially when you flashed the Klipper firmware onto your mainboard, using an old Android device as an additional screen mounted to the printer is a cheap solution for still being able to execute direct commands or having status information visible while sitting in front of your printer as the regular control unit doesn't work with the Klipper firmware anymore.

While it shouldn't be a problem if you're having a device with a separate power plug or wireless charging, it might become a problem if you'd have to use some kind of solution which splits up the line for USB charging and OTG - not all devices work with that.  Additionally, I personally would be concerned about probably harming the printers mainboard due to a faulty cable or whatever. </li> <li>What also should be mentioned here as a warning is the fact that devices which are connected 24/7 to the charger might be a huge hazard as the battery could catch fire or even blow up.

Of course a more powerful hardware can also handle a higher resolution though.

However, I personally just want to give you the advise to spend a bit more and get yourself some quality tools from well known brands. Yes, you might pay the same amount of money for one good wrench then you'd pay for a whole set, but believe me, it'll be worth it. Quality tools are made more precisely and from better material so they just last longer. So let's say you want to get yourself some hexagon socket tools, don't go for the cheapest ones out there. The cheap ones tend to become round on the edges pretty quick and it's really no fun at all to fiddle around with a 1.5mm hexagon socket tool trying to loosen up that little grub screw of the heater block with a messed up tool.

Depending on what you want to solder, you should choose the best option. Generally speaking, for small parts like thin wires, electronic components and so on, you want to use an iron with a lower wattage and a pointed tip. If you need to solder thick wires or bigger components, you most likely will choose a more powerful iron with probably a more flattened tip. Often both kinds of irons are sold in a set, like a more powerful 80W one with a wide and flat tip and a 40W iron with a pointed tip. If you don't have any soldering irons at all, you can go with one of those cheap sets.  I personally love my little 12W \"Weller Mini\" for tinkering, as it is thin and good to grab and parts don't tend to overheat quickly as it could happen when you use a 40W or 80W iron for example. There are well-priced soldering stations out there which allow you to adjust the power and the heat and which also offer a small hand piece, so I'd recommend you go for something like that.

I personally prefer to use thin solder wire with a flux core and a bit of lead in it for tinkering and soldering small parts, as the lead makes soldering easier and the thin wire allows to be more precise when adding the solder. Nowadays you'll most likely won't be able to get leaded solder wire anymore though, as lead produces toxic fumes while soldering.

If the nozzle is too close to the bed, the filament will get squished into the plate too much and that will (depending on how close the nozzle actually is) provoke clogging as well as it makes it difficult to remove the printed model later.   If the nozzle is too far away from the bed, the filament won't be squished into the build plate properly or won't stay on the bed at all.    The first layer is crucial for a perfect print, so take your time and get your z-offset dialed in well.    See the section \"Z-Offset\" for further tips and check out this handy reference as well for determining the perfect first layer.   First tip: check the underside of your print - if you can clearly see or even vaguely identify individual lines, your nozzle is still a bit too far away from the bed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of course you have to pay attention that you really cleaned the PEI plate of the bed properly using e.g. simple dishwasher soap (no balm or 'soft' soap as they often contain some oily ingredients) and IPA to make the prints stick to it. I personally prefer and highly recommend silicone remover spray (that's the stuff the guys are using who are painting cars on a professional basis to get off any oil and grease off the chassis before starting the actual paintjob), it just works great. </p> </li> <li>Avoid touching the plate with your bare hands and fingers as that'll leave a tiny amount of grease onto the plate as well.  </li> <li>Once the plate is clean, the z-offset is dialed in and the bedtemp is correct for the type of filament, the PEI plate really works great. There's no need to mess around with some sort of gluestick, tape, hairspray or whatsoever.  </li> <li>I'd also suppose to add a brim to your model (you need to do it in the slicer), which helps keeping the print staying on the plate a lot. This is especially useful for objects with a small base. You can configure the width of the brim in your slicer. After finishing the print, you just wait until the object is cooled down and then you can break/tear the brim off the object. If tiny amounts of the brim stay at the model, just use a sharp cutter.</li> <li>Also make sure that you chose the correct temperature of the bed for the filament you're using. If the bed is either too cold or too hot, then the print won't reliably stick to it either.   For PLA for example it should be around 55\u00b0C - don't exceed 60\u00b0C for PLA as that's already the glass transition temperature of PLA (means, that's where the filament starts to get soft). For PETG I personally have to use 80\u00b0C.   </li> <li>Turn off the part cooling fan when printing the first (few) layer(s) and use the correct fanspeed depending on your filament (e.g.: PLA needs a lot of cooling, PETG needs usually less cooling).     </li> <li>You also should check the functionality and position of the z-offset 'sensor' which is being used by the machine to set the initial z-offset automatically while doing the calibration procedure. So read around that section and pay special attention to the section \"Adjusting The Sensor's Height\". You still have to observe the first layer while it's being printed though and you most likely still have to adjust the z-offset on the fly while printing the initial layer! </li> <li>Also make sure that you trammed the x-axis gantry, so that the nozzle has the same distance to the plate across the whole area. This might not be enough though if you're encountering a tilted bed along the y-axis, so check the next listing.</li> <li>Check the whole construction and the frame of the printer itself. Everthing has to be set up being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant to each other. If the frame isn't trammed and e.g. the Y-axis is being mounted crooked or tilted (which is possible due to play in the whole construction), then you'll never be able to get perfect prints.  </li> <li>If you're using the rigid stock spacers (the black round parts between the bedplate and the bedgantry) that came with the printer, then it's most likely that they're not all of the same height (at my Neo they all had a different height!). Of course that'll lead to a somewhat warped or tilted bed.   Instead of fiddling around with either trying to get them all to the same height by e.g. sanding them down or by putting some sort of thin material underneath them to equalize the height, you might wanna get some adjustable spacers for the bed for being able to tram the bed itself as well. This process can be quite challenging and more annoying than taking the effort once to equalize the rigid stock spacers though, so don't think that it'll necessarily make everything easier for you. </li> <li>I'd recommend to check the bedmesh values (query M503 through a program like e.g. OctoPrint, Pronterface to get them listed) or use e.g. OctoPrint for getting a meshview out of it. By doing so you can see how 'flat' and trammed the bed is.   If it's tilted, tram it.   If it's warped or bent (like e.g. a bow) or if you're having certain spots which seem to be bulges or dents or if you have a certain area which is lower, you can use Kapton tape to equalize those areas/spots. Just take off the PEI plate, stick pieces of the Kapton tape right onto the magnetic foil of the bed, put the PEI plate back on and do another ABL sequence. Then check the values or the meshview again. By doing so step by step, you can get yourself a bed as flat as possible. Minor deviations should be compensated by the ABL function later when printing.   See the chapter \"Bed\" (mind the expandable textboxes) as well for more information.  </li> <li>Wiggle the bed and check if it moves in the vertical plane. If it does, check the bolts and nuts of the bedgantry and check the v-slot wheels for perfect position. Most likely the wheels (or at least one) are a bit too far away from the aluminum frame. Adjust the position of the wheels then, but pay attention to not adjust them too tight as well.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#stringing","title":"Stringing","text":"<p>Stringing can be caused and affected by different factors and therefore can't always be avoided by adjusting retraction settings only. You can find countless articles about it, so maybe do a little research on it. Based on my own experiences, the following variables besides the retraction settings should be taken into account as well as one probably doesn't think about them in the first place:  </p> <ul> <li>The type of filament (PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU).  </li> <li>The quality of filament.  </li> <li>The moisture of filament: moist filament increases stringing.  </li> <li>The printing temperature: too high as well as too low printing temperatures cause stringing.  </li> <li>The feeder gear pressure: if it's too low, the gear can't grab the filament reliably and therefore can't retract reliably.  </li> <li>The state of the feeder gear: if the teeth of the feeder gear which grabs the filament is kinda clogged due to debris of the filament, then it might slip as well.   </li> <li>The quality and the state of the nozzle: low-quality nozzles as well as worn out and/or slightly clogged nozzles can increase stringing. Also the diameter of the nozzle has an impact as it determines how much filament gets extruded.   </li> <li>The quality and the state of the PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak.   As an example: stringing got way better after I replaced the stock PTFE tube with a Capricorn one, it seems that the lower friction of the Capricorn tube affected the retraction capability. Also a slightly clogged and/or deformed tip of the PTFE tube affected this a lot.  </li> <li>Retraction settings, so the retraction distance and the retraction speed.   Even though one would usually assume that higher values should/would be better to avoid or at least deal with stringing, it's not always the case. So instead of e.g. going higher than 1mm retraction distance at the direct drive of the Neo (which would provoke clogging), go much lower and see how it goes.   This seems to be affected not only by the type of filament (flexible filament like TPU needs completely different settings than pretty hard filament like PLA for example), but also by the quality of filament. Often cheap filament is lighter and more flexible than high quality filament and therefore it needs lower retraction settings overall to achieve good results.   </li> <li>The object one wants to print: certain objects just caused stringing, even tho I usually printed without any stringing. I'd recommend to print retraction towers with two cone-shaped towers as well, to get the different diameter into account as well.  </li> <li>The settings of the slicer, like wiping, z-hop, outer- vs. inner perimeter and so on. There are many articles and videos about this topic, so I'd recommend to do some research on it for your specific slicer.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#holes-andor-bulges-in-layers","title":"Holes And/Or Bulges In Layers","text":"<p>These are mostly signs of under- / overextrusion and/or a clogged nozzle.  </p> <ul> <li>If you observe a regular pattern like a vertical line where these gaps and bulges occur, then it's most likely the z-seam. You could change the setting of your slicer for the z-seam to \"random\", but that'll lead to random artefacts all over the print. In that case you'll most likely also note these artefacts in other spots of your model where layers start or end.   As you can't use Linear Advance with the stock firmware, there isn't that much you can do about this under- and overextrusion an the beginning and the end of a layer besides making sure that you calibrated the e-steps correctly. You might be able to tweak some settings in your slicer though and optimize it a bit.    </li> <li>If you observe holes in layers, or even longer lines in layers where filament is missing, then it's most likely too much retraction distance and/or a (partial) clog you're dealing with (which also gets provoked by too much retraction distance btw).   So I'd recommend to check the retraction settings and clean the nozzle by e.g. doing some cold pulls.

The following picture shows a comparison of PETG - the left 'weird' looking skirt is fresh and therefore moist filament right out of the package how it came from the manufacturer, the right skirt shows the same spool after being dried.  </p> <p> </p> <p>You can also check if the filament is (way) too moist by extruding with the nozzle up in the air. Watch the string of melted filament which comes out of the hotend, right at the nozzle. Does it seem to be 'bubbly'? Do those bubbles even pop? If so, then it's definitely too moist.  </p> <p>The solution for this would be to dry your filament. You can either get yourself one of those (imho overpriced) filament dryers or use a food dehydrator. If you don't have any of them, you can use the well-controlled solution we all already have: the heated bed! Just lay your spool flat onto the bed (maybe put it on some small wooden pieces or so to raise it up a bit) and cover it with e.g. a cardboard box where you poked in some small holes and which you also placed onto some small objects to raise it up a bit and create a small gap between the box and the bedplate for a better circulation. Then heat up the bed to the specific temp you need for drying the type of filament you want to dry. Let it sit for a few hours.  </p> <p>Don't use your kitchen oven for drying filament, as those are often not capable of heating at lower temperatures (many ovens start to heat at 50\u00b0C, which is already close to the glass transition temperature of PLA, which is around 55\u00b0-60\u00b0C!) - you can end up with a big clump of a melted spool and filament! </p> <p>When storing your filament, use e.g. some vaccum sealed bags or containers and add dessicant.

This doesn't has to be a RaspberryPi, pretty much every device you could run Linux on is suitable. Just use the KIAUH script for an easy installation of the belonging software like Moonraker and e.g. Mainsail.  Please see the chapter \"Printserver\" for some hardware I listed which you could use for that. </p> <p>I'd like to mention that you don't necessarily need a host with a (touch) screen though, as the host is connected to your network and you'll access the UI of e.g. Mainsail through your browser (or by using an additional app on your smartphone or tablet, there are many ways to get in touch with your printer actually). So just to make it clear: let's assume you have an old laptop laying around with maybe a broken screen, or you only have a limited amount of space and no place to put your old laptop with a working screen - you could use both ones just fine. Just connect the device to a power outlet, to your network and to your printer, put it somewhere on a shelf or wherever it suits you and you're good.   However, there are options to e.g. add a touchscreen to your host or use an old android device with e.g Klipper Screen running and place it close to your printer, so that you have a control unit at the printer itself as well.

For further information about the installation steps please read the chapter \"Installation\" of the official Klipper documentation.  </p> <p>You can find the intial discussion about getting Klipper running on the Kobra 2 Neo here in the Klipper discourse group.  </p> <p>According to those posts, to build the correct firmware, use the following configuration during the setup process for creating the <code>klipper.bin</code> file:  </p> <ul> <li>Micro-controller Architecture: STMicroelectronics STM32</li> <li>Processor model: STM32F103</li> <li>Bootloader: 36KiB  </li> <li>Communication interface: Serial on USART2 PA3/PA2 with 115200 baud rate   (Attention: you can try using 250000 when using a USB connection as shown in the screenshot below, but then you have to adjust the according setting in the <code>printer.cfg</code> file as well!)    </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>File <code>printer.cfg</code> Available!</p> <p>Thanks to AJolly who contributed the specific file, you can now find them in the \"Kobra2Neo\" folder of the \"Klipper4Kobra2series\" repository.

I personally would suggest to remove all files from the mSD card and only copy the <code>firmware.bin</code> file onto it. Then you flash it as you would do with the stock firmware. Means, you turn off the printer, put the card into the cardreader and turn on the printer. Note that the screen doesn't update though after the flash procedure is done as the control unit doesn't work with Klipper anymore, it'll stick with the message \"Firmware update. Please wait.\"! So just wait 5-10min to make sure everything had time enough to be installed. Then turn off the printer, remove the card, connect your host which has OctoPrint/Mainsail/.. running with the printer using an USB-C cable and turn on the printer again. Now you should be able to connect OctoPrint/Mainsail/.. with the printer.

Please see the official Klipper documentation for more detailed information about this topic, I'll only mention some notes about it here in the following. So before you continue to read here, maybe check out the official Klipper documentation first and read the chapters \"Bed Level Support\" and \"Bed Level\".  </p> <p>After executing an ABL sequence, you need to save those results for having them written to your <code>printer.cfg</code> file - they won't be saved automatically!

This command <code>BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=...</code> has to be added after the last G28 (home the printer) command in there, with the belonging name of the mesh that should be loaded.

If you saved the mesh using the \"default\" name like it's being suggested by the UI, enter the name \"default\" as shown above.    </p> <p>You can create different bedmeshs for e.g. different bed temperatures by using different names and load them automagically using e.g. the belonging name of the filament type being set in the Slicer. Means, you set the filament type in your Slicer and add a certain entry in the start g-code section of the Slicer, so that the filament type will be written into the generated g-code file. In addition to that you then write a macro for Klipper which then loads the belonging bedmesh for the type of filament being used, like the bedmesh you did at 60\u00b0C bed temperature for printing PLA or the one you did at 80\u00b0C for printing PETG.    </p> <p>You can configure the ABL procedure within your <code>printer.cfg</code> as well so that it fits your needs. Means, you can change the amount and location of probing points, the probing speed and the amount of probes for each probing point.

Once everything is done, adjust the belt tension again by turning the knob clockwise.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#belt-tension","title":"Belt Tension","text":"<p>It's kinda difficult to explain the correct belt tension, so you'd have to experiment a bit with that. Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft which will do harm, the belt can snap etc. - if it's too loose though, the belt might even slip. Either state (too tensioned and too loose) can cause artifacts.   </p> <p>My 'rule of thumb' here is: if you can bend the belt down a bit by applying some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel a good amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. So start from there and if you feel or need to do so, play around with different belt tensions while printing the same bject over and over again for finding the best tension for your setup.   </p> Some Notes On Belt Tension <p>People often recommend \"Tighten your belts!\", but that's actually not always the solution if artifacts like layer shifts occur. As a matter of fact, I made many different tests with my Neos and evaluated the different influences of factors like belt tension, wheel position, quality of ball bearings of the wheels, a trammed vs. untrammed frame/printer setup and so on. And to be honest: a belt being too loose in terms of being the cause for severe problems only occured when it was really that loose that even someone who has no experience at all with this would notice it. If a belt is sagging, I'd assume that a user would notice that and realizes that this can't be good.   </p> <p>Don't get me wrong - of course different tensions of the belts do have a certain influence of the quality of the print, and it might be worth to finetune the tension for getting the last little amount of perfection out of your print. And yes, of course, if a belt is too loose, then it can slip or it can cause layer shifts due to a slight 'lag' which occurs when the motors start to drive the belt or when a sudden change of the direction occurs. But: a belt being too tight can cause artifacts as well. Not only that - it can and actually will harm the hardware. Users reported not only snapped belts or harmed motors, one even reported a bent bracket where the motor of the Y-axis was mount to. So, believe me or not: even though there are people in forums and on YouTube who claim that a belt can't be too tight - it definitely can.  </p> <p>Using the abovementioned 'method' of roughly setting your belt tension to a 'medium' value, I found that other factors have a much bigger impact on the print quality and the reliability and well-functioning of the whole printer. Let me give you two short examples to show you what I mean:  </p> <ul> <li>If your wheels are too tight, of course you also need to increase the belt tension - but in that case it's not the belt tension what's causing the issue in the first place, it's the wrong position of the wheels.  </li> <li>If you have bad ball bearings at the wheels (which is actually most likely the case due to the cheap parts being used), then those may cause an irregular/inconsistent movement of the wheels and you can feel regular 'hiccups' while moving the belonging part (like the bedgantry or the printhead). You can feel how you have to apply more force at certain spots when moving the part manually by hand, as it feels like it's getting stuck at certain spots. So a belt being too loose isn't the cause of the problem here and therefore tightening up your belt isn't the solution - replacing the bad bearings with some quality ones is.  </li> </ul> <p>So, use your brain and don't always follow the typical answers like \"Tighten you belts!\" when you're experiencing issues like layer shifts for example. Instead, look at your printer more 'holistic' and see the different parts which are working together in the end. Pay attention to each of them, once again starting by inspecting the frame and making sure everything is still trammed and set up well here. Due to vibrations and repetitive motions screws can come loose, parts can and will wear out and therefore a frame or other parts you set up a while ago can and will come out of alignment by time.</p> Broken/Snapped Belt <p>When you experience a broken/snapped/ripped belt, it's most likely caused by too much belt tension. Of course the belt itself can be physically harmed as well when grinding across sharp edges or when it gets old, but you should notice that when examining the belt every now and then when doing the regular maintenace of your printer.  </p> <p>If you encounter a snapped belt, get yourself a good quality one as a replacement - don't go with the cheapest no-name product you can get. I'd suggest to look out for an original \"Gates Powergrip\u00ae\" belt. You can get them in different lengths, like one or five meters. Then get yourself some of those metal clamps you have to crimp at the ends of the belts as well. If you feel insecure about how to properly add those clamps to the belt and how to actually crimp them properly, practice crimping a few to your old broken belt.  </p> <p>Crimp one of those clamps to one end of the belt, measure the belonging length of the belt and apply the other one, then cut off the rest of it. Install the belt by disassembling the belonging parts like the belt tensioners (see the notes on how to do so in the belonging sections). Pay attention to route the belt in the correct way and not being twisted and adjust the tension of the belt once everything is reassembled.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#maintenance","title":"Maintenance","text":"<p>You should inspect the belts and the belonging parts like pulleys etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break.  </p> <ul> <li>Belt:</li> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li> <p>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pulleys:  </p> </li> <li>Check the pulleys of the motors which are driving the belts.

Therefore you need to switch the position of two wires, best would be to check the coils with a multimeter first! Please read the expandable textbox below for further information.</p> Identifying The Coils And Connections <p>When you want to use a different motor than the stock ones, it's most likely the case that the coils are connected to different pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following.  </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given.  </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin. Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another. Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that. Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process. In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil.  </p> <p>Now look at the following picture and compare your findings with the marked pins of the two coils of the upper \"Stock Motor\" (right now the following picture shows the y-axis motor compared to the Creality motor, but the motors, pinouts and the procedure of probing are actually the same).  </p> <p> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away.  </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing. At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here.  </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact. Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out. Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little \"click\" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out.  </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now.  </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor. In that case proceed as above and switch the wiring accordingly.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#v-slot-wheels","title":"V-Slot Wheels","text":"<p>The wheels of the printhead's mounting plate are leading the printhead along the aluminum profile of the x-axis (the so-called \"x-axis gantry\").

We (try) to get the machine and certain parts of it aligned perfectly, like axes and parts being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant towards each other. For example, we try to set up the frame being mounted perfectly square, the z-axis frame being perpendicular to the base frame, the x-axis gantry being perpendicular to the z-axis frame and the bed being parallel and equidistant to the x-axis gantry and the printhead/nozzle. It's a technical term which is also used at CNC machines for example and this is the correct nomenclature. And as a matter of fact, this is also the case with 3d printers. Point.  </p> <p>\"Leveling\" though is the process of bringing something like a shelf, a table or a framed picture hanging at the wall into the position that it's perpendicular to gravity so to say. Most of the time you do so by taking a bubble level or a self-leveling laser. But this is NOT how you 'level' the bed of your 3d printer for example! </p> <p>Yes, I'm highly aware of the fact that the majority of the 3d printing community uses the term 'leveling', that people say \"Level your bed!\" and that the marketing guys and gals of the companies use the (even more misleading!) term \"Automatic Bed Leveling\" (which is even worse as it suggests that the process will actually 'level' the bed itself - which it obviously doesn't). But that doesn't mean that I have to follow that misleading road.  So besides the fact that this isn't the correct nomenclature (seriously, I'm not the grammar police - I'm a German guy who speaks a little bit of English..), my 'problem' with this term is that it's just really misleading!  </p> <p>How many beginners are pulling out their bubble level, put it on the bed or the x-axis gantry to check if it's leveled and maybe even shim out the table the printer stands on - just to come to the conclusion that their bed or gantry is leveled? Believe it or not: many - whether you came across those users while trying to help them or not. You can use a 3d printer on a tilted table - if the printer is trammed, it'll still print fine.   </p> <p>So to all those haters out there: yes, I will continue to use the correct term \"tramming\", no matter how much you'll attack and try to insult me. And no, I don't do it because I want to show the world that I know the correct term, I do it because I want to avoid that beginners become frustrated because they just get it wrong. And if you haters would start to actually do the same, then maybe one day there might occur a shift in the 'consciousness' of the community and the correct term would be used on a regular basis. Seriously, try to help people out by just using the correct term for making them realize that it's not about how perpendicular the bed or gantry is towards gravity - and stop harrassing people who already do so.  </p> <p>It's advisable to tram the x-axis gantry to either the bed itself or the frame, depending on the type of spacers of the bedmount. By doing so, you make sure that the bed and the gantry are parallel to each other and therefore the distance of the nozzle to the plate is pretty much the same all along the x-axis.  </p> <p>As the printers come with rigid spacers (the black plastic pieces between the bedplate and the bed gantry), you aren't really able to \"tram\" the bed unless you replace the stock spacers with adjustable ones.   The problem with those rigid stock spacers is, that they most likely aren't all of the same length/height - so I'd recommend to at least dismount them, check if they're all of the same height and if they aren't, sand them down to an equal height. By doing so you can at least make sure that you won't have a tilted or warped bed caused by spacers of different legth. See the section \"Tramming The Bed\" for further information and instructions.  Make sure to take care of this before actually starting to tram the x-axis gantry, as you'll tram it in relation to the bed. </p> <p>After taking care of the spacers (either the stock ones or after getting yourself new adjustable ones), reassemble everything. Now you can proceed tramming the x-axis gantry:  </p> <ul> <li>If you're using the rigid stock spacers, tram the gantry in relation to the bed itself.  </li> <li>If you're using adjustable spacers, tram the gantry in relation to the frame itself and then tram the bed in relation to the nozzle at different positions (see the section \"Tramming The Bed\" for further information and instructions about it).     </li> </ul> <p>Please see the expandable textbox below for further instructions about how to tram the x-axis gantry.  </p> Tramming The X-Axis Gantry And Adjusting The Wheels <p>When it comes down to tramming the x-axis gantry, up to me one should differ between tramming it in relation to the frame of the printer and in relation to the bed. Depending on which spacers are being used, you should either do the one or the other:  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Tram in relation to the bed, if you're using the stock spacers, because you can't really \"tram\" the bed itself. Make sure you checked the rigid stock spacers of the bedmount for an equal height before tramming the gantry though! If they're not all of the same height, I'd recommend to sand them down to the height of the shortest spacer.  </p> </li> <li> <p>If you've swapped the stock spacers and are using adjustable ones, like silicone spacers or springs, then you should tram in relation to the frame itself to make sure everything is square and perpendicular like it should be. Of course the whole frame has to be assembled correctly first, so make sure the base frame really is mounted square and the aluminum parts of the z-axis frame really are perpendicular to the base frame!    In this case follow the steps being mentioned in the following, but instead of placing two identical objects onto the bed, place them onto the base frame and rest the aluminum part of the x-axis gantry onto them. After bringing those y-shaped metal brackets into the correct position, make sure to retighten the screws while the aluminum frame of the x-axis is perpendicular to the aluminum frame of the z-axis at both sides.   After that, tram the bed itself to the x-axis gantry by adjusting the height of the bed by using the screws and adjust it at the four corners to the same distance of the nozzle (e.g. 0.1mm by using a feeler gauge or a sheet of paper).  </p> </li> </ol> <p>Note: the following description is for tramming the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed itself when using the rigid stock spacers! If you're using adjustable spacers, the procedure is pretty much the same, you just have to put two pieces of equal height onto the frame of the printer (where the z-axis aluminum frame is mounted onto) and rest the x-axis gantry onto them instead of placing those pieces on the bed itself! </p> <ul> <li> <p>In order to tram the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed, so that both are as parallel as possible, take two parts of equal height like cans for example and place them onto the left and right side of the bed.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Put the two objects (here: cans) on the bedplate and drive the x-axis gantry up/down until it's about 5mm lower than the cans.  </p> </li> <li>Take out the two screws which attach the anti-backlash nuts to their respective mounting brackets at the x-gantry, so that you can move the x-gantry upwards without the anti-backlash nut being attached. You want the gantry to rest on the cans later only by it's own weight!    </li> <li>Now lift the gantry with your hand and slide the two cans underneath it - don't spin the lead screw to raise the gantry! </li> <li>Make sure to have the cans positioned as far to the sides of the bed as possible, but only that far that only the aluminum frame of the gantry touches them!   This is crucial - you don't want those y-shaped metal brackets touch the cans at all!  </li> <li>Now lower the gantry carefully until it rests on the cans.  </li> <li>Check if the 'noses' of the anti-backlash nuts still sit in that notch of those y-shaped metal brackets how it should be while there's still a little gap between the upper side of them and the corresponding mounting brackets. See the following picture for a better understanding what I'm talking about.    If it's not the case and the nuts are either too low (so that those 'noses' aren't sitting in that notch) or too high (so that there isn't a gap between them and the mounting bracket), slowly turn the lead of that side accordingly until it looks like in the picture shown above.   </li> <li> <p>Once you're done with that, pay close attention to the position of the gantry on those cans.   The following picture shows the crooked gantry resting on one can (the right one), where there's a noticeable gap between it and the left can. </p> </li> <li> <p>Note: if you didn't take care of cleaning and lubing the lead screw yet as well as checking the whole z-axis lead screw system for perfect vertical alignment and the anti-backlash nut for a correct installation, this is the perfect time to do so! Don't skip this! Please see the belonging textbox below in the section \"Z-Axis\". </p> </li> <li> <p>Now loosen the two hexagon socket screws at each side of the aluminum frame of the gantry which are holding each of the Y-shaped metal plates (where the wheels are mounted onto, at the backside so to say) against it. Don't take them out (!), just loosen them a bit.   You need to turn the printer around for being able to actually get access to those screws. The following pictures show the locations of those screws. </p> </li> <li> <p>The goal now is to bring these brackets into position so that the rail of this x-gantry completely rests on those cans like the following picture shows.    For achieving this, you now might have to move the brackets a bit up or down to get everything aligned up well, so follow the next steps.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The following picture illustrates the following steps for achieving the perfect position.  Note: with adjusting the position of the inner wheels by turning the eccentric nut (now and later as well), you only adjust the pressure and how tight the wheels sit and run along the z-axis frame. The position of the outer wheels only can be achieved by positioning them manually as described. </p> </li> <li> <p>With those brackets being loose, adjust their position by slightly wiggling and turning them until the outer wheels of them touch the aluminum frame of the z-axis. Do one bracket at each time.   Don't pay (too much) attention to the inner wheel yet though, as you'll adjust the position of it in the following step. Remember: right now you want to achieve that the bracket is in the position that both of the two outer wheels touch the aluminum frame.   Once you found that perfect position of that bracket, hold it in place with one hand, press down the rail of that x-gantry onto the cans once again for making sure it rests on both of them and then tighten the two bolts again to secure the brackets in it's position while still holding the bracket into position.   Do this for both sides.   Once done with this, make sure the x-gantry still rests on the cans equally. Move the gantry up and down a bit and see if everything looks and feels alright.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Now adjust the position of the inner wheels by turning the eccentric nuts in the correct position. You want to achieve that all three wheels touch the frame. Make sure to not position those inner wheels too tight against that rail - it should sit good in that v-slot, but you don't want to tighten them up too much which would cause too much resistance and unnecessary wear and tear.   Do this for both sides.   The following picture shows an eccentric nut which I painted to make the special shape of it more visible.    As you hopefully can see, the bolt isn't centered - so if you turn that eccentric nut while being mounted, the position of the bolt and therefore the whole wheel will be changed, either towards or away from the v-slot of the rail it's sitting at. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you did this, pay attention to the rail of the x-axis gantry again once again - you want it to rest completely equal on both cans.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Now all of the wheels should touch the aluminum frame of the z-axis and the x-axis gantry should be as parallel to the bed as possible. The y-shaped brackets should be at pretty much the same position as well.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Now that you still have the lead screw dismounted, move the gantry up and down along the z-axis again.   Does the movement feel smooth and easy-going? Or do you feel any kind of (unusual) resistance or hiccups? If you feel hiccups, you might have bad ball bearings in one or more than one wheels,  which you should replace with new ones then.     Is the gantry somehow sloppy on one side, or is it 'sturdy' and you don't have unwanted 'play' at one side?   If necessary (like if it's either moving not smooth enough or if it feels sloppy), slightly adjust the position of the inner wheel and check everything again.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Once everything seems to be perfect, reinstall the lead screw.  </p> </li> <li> <p>When everything is set up again, move the z-axis up and down by using the control unit. Again, everything should move smooth. Home the z-axis and you should be good to go!   </p> </li> </ul> <p>Congratulations, you just trammed the x-axis gantry! </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#y-axis","title":"Y-Axis","text":"<p>The y-axis is belt driven (GT-2 type, 6mm wide).

Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft which will do harm, the belt can snap etc. - if it's too loose though, the belt might even slip. Either state (too tensioned and too loose) can cause artifacts.   </p> <p>My 'rule of thumb' here is: if you can bend the belt down a bit by applying some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel a good amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. So start from there and if you feel or need to do so, play around with different belt tensions while printing the same bject over and over again for finding the best tension for your setup.   </p> Some Notes On Belt Tension <p>People often recommend \"Tighten your belts!\", but that's actually not always the solution if artifacts like layer shifts occur. As a matter of fact, I made many different tests with my Neos and evaluated the different influences of factors like belt tension, wheel position, quality of ball bearings of the wheels, a trammed vs. untrammed frame/printer setup and so on. And to be honest: a belt being too loose in terms of being the cause for severe problems only occured when it was really that loose that even someone who has no experience at all with this would notice it. If a belt is sagging, I'd assume that a user would notice that and realizes that this can't be good.   </p> <p>Don't get me wrong - of course different tensions of the belts do have a certain influence of the quality of the print, and it might be worth to finetune the tension for getting the last little amount of perfection out of your print. And yes, of course, if a belt is too loose, then it can slip or it can cause layer shifts due to a slight 'lag' which occurs when the motors start to drive the belt or when a sudden change of the direction occurs. But: a belt being too tight can cause artifacts as well. Not only that - it can and actually will harm the hardware. Users reported not only snapped belts or harmed motors, one even reported a bent bracket where the motor of the Y-axis was mount to. So, believe me or not: even though there are people in forums and on YouTube who claim that a belt can't be too tight - it definitely can.  </p> <p>Using the abovementioned 'method' of roughly setting your belt tension to a 'medium' value, I found that other factors have a much bigger impact on the print quality and the reliability and well-functioning of the whole printer. Let me give you two short examples to show you what I mean:  </p> <ul> <li>If your wheels are too tight, of course you also need to increase the belt tension - but in that case it's not the belt tension what's causing the issue in the first place, it's the wrong position of the wheels.  </li> <li>If you have bad ball bearings at the wheels (which is actually most likely the case due to the cheap parts being used), then those may cause an irregular/inconsistent movement of the wheels and you can feel regular 'hiccups' while moving the belonging part (like the bedgantry or the printhead). You can feel how you have to apply more force at certain spots when moving the part manually by hand, as it feels like it's getting stuck at certain spots. So a belt being too loose isn't the cause of the problem here and therefore tightening up your belt isn't the solution - replacing the bad bearings with some quality ones is.  </li> </ul> <p>So, use your brain and don't always follow the typical answers like \"Tighten you belts!\" when you're experiencing issues like layer shifts for example. Instead, look at your printer more 'holistic' and see the different parts which are working together in the end. Pay attention to each of them, once again starting by inspecting the frame and making sure everything is still trammed and set up well here.

I'd suggest to look out for an original \"Gates Powergrip\u00ae\" belt. You can get them in different lengths, like one or five meters. Then get yourself some of those metal clamps you have to crimp at the ends of the belts as well. If you feel insecure about how to properly add those clamps to the belt and how to actually crimp them properly, practice crimping a few to your old broken belt.  </p> <p>Crimp one of those clamps to one end of the belt, measure the belonging length of the belt and apply the other one, then cut off the rest of it. Install the belt by disassembling the belonging parts like the belt tensioners (see the notes on how to do so in the belonging sections). Pay attention to route the belt in the correct way and not being twisted and adjust the tension of the belt once everything is reassembled.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#maintenance_3","title":"Maintenance","text":"<p>You should inspect the belts and the belonging parts like pulleys etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break.  </p> <ul> <li>Belt:</li> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li> <p>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pulleys:  </p> </li> <li>Check the pulleys of the motors which are driving the belts.

The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following.  </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given.  </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin. Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another. Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that. Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process. In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil.  </p> <p>Now look at the following picture and compare your findings with the marked pins of the two coils of the upper \"Stock Motor\".  </p> <p> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away.  </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing. At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here.  </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact. Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out. Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little \"click\" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out.  </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now.  </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor.

This rod is mounted to the 5mm shaft of the motor by a rigid coupler at the bottom. The top end of the rod is completely unguided.

One step is 0.04mm, so it's better to set e.g. 0.2mm or 0.16mm layer heights instead of e.g. 0.18mm or 0.15mm.  </p> <p>To understand it better, I'll try to give a simple explanation of what a full step of a motor is and what microstepping of a motor is, before I'll explain the 'math' behind the magic number. If you're interested in a more precise and proper technical description of how exactly a stepper motor works, please search the web for an adequate source.  For a better understanding of the following description, see the following picture which shows the inside of a stepper motor. </p> <p>We have motors which execute 200 full steps to rotate the shaft of the motor for a full 360\u00b0 rotation, where each step is a movement of 1.8\u00b0 (there are also 'high resolution' stepper motors which do 400 steps with 0.9\u00b0 movement per full step, but we have motors which do the mentioned 200 steps). This is based on how the motor is built in the inside with it's permanent magnet motor and the stator coils which make the shaft of the motor turn in the end.  At each of these 200 steps with 1.8\u00b0 movement, the motor 'rests' in that specific position due to the positions of the permanent magnets in the inside. Means, these positions are 'given', there don't occur any deviations or misalignments.  </p> <p>Then we have microstepping. Microstepping is dividing one full step in a number of smaller steps, the so called microsteps. In our case we have 16 microsteps being used (other setups can use up to 256 microsteps). For making this mircostepping possible, the belonging stepper motor driver (which is a chip on the mainboard, in this case a TMC2209) adjusts the current of the stator coil in a way that the permanent magnet motor will be hold in a position between two full steps. So the motor doesn't 'rest' in a certain position due to the force of the magnets, it's being 'hold' in an intermediate position between two magnets which are next to each other so to say. In our case with a 1.8\u00b0 rotation per full step and 16 subsequent microsteps, each microstep is a movement of 0.0025mm, because one full step is 0.04mm. But, due to the fact that the motor is being 'hold' in that position between two magnets like it's floating, this movement isn't 100% precise. So in reality it's not exactly altering it's position of 0.0025mm when a microstep is executed, it's more like it's moving approximately 0.0025mm. And this is already the reason why it's smart to choose a layer height which is a multiple of full steps, just because the movement is more 'precise' due to the fact that the motor moves from magnet to magnet instead of being hold in a somewhat-position in between. There are other additional reasons as well like that the torque is heavily reduced when microstepping, but I won't go into further details about that.     </p> <p>Now that you know the basic principle of how a stepper motor works and what the difference of a full step and a microstep is, you might wonder why the up and down movement of the z-axis is 0.04mm for a full step now.  Here's the 'math' behind it:  </p> <ul> <li>The stepper motor of the z-axis does 200 steps per revolution (1.8\u00b0 per full step for a 360\u00b0 rotation).</li> <li>The lead screw is 8mm in diameter.  </li> <li>There are 4 starts (= thread paths) at the lead screw.  </li> <li>The lead screw has 2mm pitch.  </li> <li>4 starts multiplied by 2mm pitch is 8mm lead per one full rotation of the lead screw. In other words: for every 360\u00b0 rotation the motor shaft and therefore the lead screw does, the z-axis moves (either up or down) 8mm.    Therefore we have the 8mm lead divided by 200 steps per revolution, which then results in 0.04mm movement per step.  </li> </ul> <p>Doing the math, you'll realize that e.g. 0.16mm layer height = 4 full steps, 0.2mm l.h. = 5 full steps and so on. Now we remember that a microstep is ~0.0025mm. So when choosing a layer height like e.g. 0.15mm, the motor has to do 3 full steps (3*0.04mm=0.12mm) and 12 microsteps (12*0.0025mm=0.03mm). But because a microstep is a position which is somewhat 'floating' due to the fact that it's being held between two magnets instead of 'resting' in a position facing one magnet, the chosen 0.15mm layer height is not as precise as the 0.16mm or 0.2mm which is a multiple of 0.04mm full steps. Therefore it's smart to always choose layer heights which can be fully divided by 0.04mm.  </p> <p>Now you probably ask yourself if it really affects the outcome of the printed part in the end and if it's worth it paying attention to this, and imho the answer \"maybe not that much\" and \"yes\". You probably won't be able to tell the difference in terms of quality when looking at two parts with the bare eye. But what's the advantage of using a layer height of 0.15mm (where a somewhat unprecise microstepping has to be used) instead of just choosing 0.16mm layer height (which consists of full steps)? Exactly - there isn't any advantage. So, imho: yes, it's worth paying attention to this, because if we can somewhat improve the quality and accuracy of a print by just making one smart decision - then why shouldn't we do it?   </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#lead-screw","title":"Lead Screw","text":"<p>The printer has one lead screw only.

Please read the expandable textbox below for further information.</p> Identifying The Coils And Connections <p>When you want to use a different motor than the stock ones, it's most likely the case that the coils are connected to different pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following.  </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given.  </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin. Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another. Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that. Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process. In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil.  </p> <p>Now look at the following picture and compare your findings with the marked pins of the two coils of the upper \"Stock Motor\" (mind that the picture shows the motor of the y-axis right now, but it's actually the same pinout and probing procedure at the z-axis motor).  </p> <p> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away.  </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing. At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here.  </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact. Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out. Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little \"click\" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out.  </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now.  </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor. In that case proceed as above and switch the wiring accordingly.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#limit-switch_2","title":"Limit Switch","text":"<p>There is no physical limit switch at the z-axis.

That's basically a holder/aligner with a ball bearing in the center which sits on top of the lead screw and mount the holder to the gantry to eliminate wobbling of the lead screw. For doing so, they print a construction and add a ball bearing, there are different STL files available for this solution.  </p> <p>However, as much as it may seem useful at first sight, I personally vote against this. In my opinion it's better if the top of the lead screw can move freely to avoid putting extra pressure on the lead screw, the frame and associated parts - especially in this case where we don't have a high precision type of construction and parts. If the guidance at the top doesn't allow at least minimal movement, then this could result in shear forces and even in bending the lead screw itself which would cause jamming or banding caused by the z-axis, also the anti-backlash nut will mist likely wear out earlier.  </p> Analogy To Fixed Vs. Free End Of The Z-Axis <p>The reason for this is quite simple, yet it seems that people aren't aware of it, so I'll try to explain it with an analogy. Think of the z-axis lead screw like it's a pool cue which is curved like the really bad ones you have to play with in certain bars. So when you put the cue on the table and roll it - what happens? It'll bump and stutter, there won't be a smooth movement, right? So now imagine a friend is holding the top and the bottom of it in place while you're holding it somewhere at the middle for example. Your friend here is the coupler and the holder at the top of the lead screw, you're the anti-backlash nut. So when your friend tries to turn the cue by rotatin it at the bottom while both of you still hold the other two spots - what happens? Will you as the 'anti-backlash nut' feel the wiggle and the forces or will it turn smooth? Exactly, you'll feel it - depending on how much the cue is bent and where exactly you placed your hand you'll either feel it stronger or weaker. So now let's place this cue on the edge of the table, so that only the bottom part lays on it. Again you place your hand somewhere in the middle and hold the cue tight, the end of the cue is just in the air. So when your friend rotates the cue again at the bottom - what will happen? Exactly, the end of the cue will wiggle around and you won't feel the forces that strong anymore like before. Now you and your friend still hold the cue at these positions, but both of you allow a tiny bit of movement, like you allow to move your arms just a tiny bit, following the movement of the cue. Again your friend rotates the cue at the bottom while the top of the cue can still wiggle around in the air. What will happen? Exactly, you as the 'anti-backlash nut' guy won't feel pretty much any forces or stuttering anymore. I know, using analogies isn't always a good idea to explain things, but I hope it became at least a bit more clear to you why (imho) the end of the lead screw shouldn't be rigidly fixed and why I suppose to use a flexible coupler at the bottom and an Oldham coupler in the middle where the anti-backlash nut is mounted to the frame.   </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#mod-dual-driven-z-axis","title":"MOD: Dual Driven Z-Axis","text":"<p>The following mods show possibilities of adding a second lead screw and therefore avoid the potential sagging/lagging of the right part of the x-axis gantry as much as possible.  </p> <p>Whichever solution (belt driven or two motors) you prefer, you need a different Y-shaped bracket than the one being installed for mounting the anti-backlash nut of the second lead screw to it, which then drives the x-axis gantry.

Are there any dents in the thread or any kind of deformation that shouldn't be there? Is it really straight or is it somehow bent (roll it across a flat surface)? If so, it would be best to get a new lead screw and replace it.    Is the anti-backlash nut worn out like in the picture shown below?

Don't be excessive here and drown it with oil - just use a tiny bit to make it glide better. Don't use WD-40 or grease which contains graphite or MoS2!  I personally like to use PTFE spray first, let it dry and then put some synthetic lube on which is made for mountainbike chains as it uses to stick a bit better onto the metal. If you have, you can also use synthetic grease like PTFE or silicone grease (\"Super Lube\"), it should work even better. You can draw a line of oil all along one side of the rod from the bottom to the top and then put the rod between your fingers and turn it. By doing so, the excessive oil will build up at your fingers and will also reach the bottom of the rod. Wipe off any excessive amount of oil afterwards again - you don't want to have oil dripping down on your motor later!

Fact is, that the chemicals inside of it will even wash off any grease or oil, it can harm POM and rubber and so on. As an example: So let's say you want to lubricate your bike chain and use WD-40 to do so, you'll basically wash away the existent lubrification  which is inside the chain - therefore the chain will be worn out pretty quick. You'll also harm the sealings.

So at e.g. 20\u00b0C bed temperature the resistance will be ~125k Ohm, at 30\u00b0C it'll be ~81k Ohm. There are general data sheets for this kind of thermistor to find with list the different resistance values at given temperatures.

It also takes longer for the bed to cool down which became impressively clear after doing a PID tune for the bed and comparing the graphs of before and after adding the insulation as the following screenshots will show. The first screenshot shows the bed temperature (blue graph) before the insulation while doing a PID tuning. The temperature is set to 60\u00b0C, after reaching that temperature the bed cools down to 55\u00b0C and heats up to 60\u00b0C again (and so on). The second screenshot shows the same process but with installed insulation.

If you use the beforementioned 25mm springs and longer screws, you should be fine as they are longer then the stock spacers anyway.     If you'll use the stock spacers or silicone spacers of about the same size, you can add bolt nuts underneath to raise the bed. However, it's advisable though to get yourself longer spacers then!   </li> <li> <p>It's also advisable to have Kapton tape on hand to cover the whole underside of the bedplate with it (before you actually apply the insulation) and to secure the edges and sides of the insulation (after applying the insulation)!     Make sure that no bubbles are trapped between the Kapton tape and the surface of the bed's underside then! And do a proper cleaning of the surface to avoid that the tape will (partially) come off!   </p> </li> <li> <p>For adding the insulation, you need to dismount the bedplate from the gantry by taking out the four screws (remove the PEI coated plate first tho).

Put the plate onto the insulation (but don't peel off the protective layer of the adhesive yet!), align it and mark the four holes of the screws.  </p> </li> <li>Then place the bed upside down on a flat and clean surface - wipe the surface beforehand tho to make sure that there's no dirt or even metal chips which would press into or stick onto the magnetic surface. Now use IPA or (which I prefer) silicone remover to wipe the underside of the bed where the insulation should be applied to and clean off any dirt or grease from your fingers.  </li> <li>Now lay down the insulation onto the bed like if you would apply it (but still with the protective layer on the adhesive!) and adjust the position. Mark the area where the wires are connected to the bed as well and cut away that part of the insulation. </li> <li>Place the spacers above the premarked holes and cut away the insulation in that area as well, so that the spacers will touch the plate later without any insulation between. I'd recommend to mark the areas that should be cut and then take the insulation away from the bedplate, so that you don't harm the surface when using a sharp knife or so.   </li> <li>When it comes down to finally apply the insulation, I personally would suggest to cover the whole surface of the bed with Kapton tape first, just in case you'd have to tear off the insulation in the future. I also added two layers of Kapton tape especially above the contacts and the little piece of foam of the thermistor in the center of the bed and marked that area roughly at the insulation, just in case I'd have to replace the thermistor in the future. Make sure there are no bubbles trapped underneath the Kapton tape though!  |     Note: Looking back, I now would remove that piece of foam which covers the thermistor in the middle to make sure the insulation covers the bed without any air trapped in between! Cover that hole of the thermistor with Kapton tape though before you apply the insulation.  </li> <li>Once everything is done and prepared, you can finally apply the insulation. Make sure you start at one side to avoid any bubbles, you want the insulation to stick on the bed equally. If some of the insulation protrudes beyond the plate, cut it off. The following picture shows the applied insulation.  </li> <li>I highly recommend to additionally secure the insulation by using some pieces of Kapton tape as well to ensure that the edges and sides of the insulation won't come loose.

Pay attention to get the foil onto the bed smooth and even - there shouldn't be any bubbles of trapped air or even 'wrinkles' of the foil!

At this point this is just mentioned here for demonstration purposes only, I'm not yet recommending to modify the Kobra 2 Neo like this. This is only due to the assumption that the springs that are needed for the following mod might add some instability to the bedplate, which could negatively effect the outcome when printing at the maximum speeds of 250mm/s and with high accelerations Anycubic is advertising for this machine.*   </p> <p>I did a bit of tinkering and modded the bedmount to a 3 point bed mount instead of the classic 4 point mount.  </p> <p>The reason for that is simple, but let me explain it a bit. When I started with 3d printing and noticed how the bedplates are mounted to the gantry using 4 mounting points, I was actually a bit irritated. I got even more irritated after I discovered that this seems to be a common method at bedslingers, even when they offer manual bed tramming like at an Ender 3 for example. Afaik, the best method to tram a rigid and flat surface is by using three points with two points being located along one axis (let's say the y-axis) and the third point being located perpendicular to that axis (so this is the x-axis in this example) at the (opposite) side in the middle of those two points:   - One of those two points located along the same axis is then used as the reference - you mount the plate there and never touch it again. - The second point at this axis is then used for adjusting the tilt along this axis (in this example along the y-axis), it's called \"pitch\". - The third point at the (opposite) side which is located in 'between' those first two mounting points is then used to adjust the tilt along that axis being perpendicular towards the first one (so in this example along the x-axis). This point is referred to as \"roll\". So when attempting to tram/level that surface then, you only have to adjust the pitch first and then adjust the roll. By doing so, you (should) end up with a perfectly trammed/leveled surface.</p> <p>So seeing all those bedslingers having the bed mounted to the gantry using four mounting points, one in each corner, I actually got really confused and started doubting and thinking about what I've learned in the past before I started to get my hands on a 3d printer. Maybe it was a 4 point mounting because of the bed being heated up? Maybe it was because the plate was pretty thin? But then the effect of heating it up and tramming it by tightening 4 screws in a somewhat 'pattern' must result in a weird warped surface withe the effect and outcome would be pretty much unpredictable!? So I did a bit of a research and thankfully discovered an article where exactly this circumstance is being described and explained for 3d printers. I highly recommend reading it! </p> <p>So, long story short: I decided trying to mod my printer's gantry and bedmount to a 3 point system.  To keep this section 'short', please see the expandable textbox below for the further description.  </p> 3 Point Bed Mount Mod <p>I gathered through my workshop and found an aluminum pofile which seemed to be useful for this attempt. I cut two pieces and drilled the belonging holes (the distance was about 164mm and I used a 5mm drill which gave me a bit of a play while installing it): one at each end for mounting the profiles to the bedplate and the gantry using the existing holes and threads, and one in the exact middle for the screw which then would be my 'roll' mounting point. The holes in the middle had to have a bit of an offset to each other as I used L-shaped aluminum profiles for better stability, so that the profiles won't hit each other when lowering the bed.    </p> <p> </p> <p>After mounting a screw to the middle of the part which will be attached to the bedplate, I then mounted the parts to the bedgantry and the bed itself. As I have insulation added to the bedplate, I had to use bushings/spacers so that the insulation won't be compressed at the two mounting holes. I used some slightly too short spacers here first, which immediately lead to a bent bedplate due to the insulation pushing against the bed, especially in the middle section. After swapping out those spacers and using longer ones, everything worked out fine. Of course I didn't found screws with the perfect length, but as I didn't want to drive t o the hardware store just for two screws and I didn't want to cut the original screws, I ended up using those. I also drilled the existing holes in the bedplate a tiny bit bigger for allowing a bit of movement which should take care of the expanding material while heating up.  After adding a spring to that screw in the middle, I then mounted everything together.  </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This is how it looks like in total from the front. I took the picture with the construction being untrammed to show the tilt (which will be adjusted by the 'roll' then) of the right side better.  </p> <p></p> <p>Right now I still have to take off the PEI plate (or at least lift the left front corner) for accessing and adjusting the screw for the pitch (because that one is still screwed into the thread of the gantry) which I chose the front left screw should be (the back left screw is my reference), the screw for the roll (which is now the screw in the middle at the right side) I can access from underneath the bed though which makes it easy to adjust. I'll probably end up changing the setup for the screw of the pitch as well. </p> <p>I then continued with a rough tramming without the PEI plate being applied, adjusting only the 'pitch' and then the 'roll' after having the 'reference' set to the desired height. After that, I put on the pEI plate and excetuted the probing for a bedmesh (7x7 grid using Klipper) with the bed being cold - the result looked promising.  </p> <p></p> <p>Then I heated up the bed and immediately did a new bedmesh - and I was actually kinda shocked, as I've never seen a heavily warped bed like that before. The promising thing though was, that the warp was somewhat consistent - it looked like a wave instead of a crooked pillow like before when being mounted at the 4 points.  </p> <p></p> <p>I then let it settle for about 10-15min before executing another probing sequence.  </p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, there is still some room for finetuning, like lowering the front by adjusting the pitch and adding some Kapton tape to certain spots as well for getting the bed as flat as possible overall, but as I was too lazy at that point and had stuff to print, I didn't do it then.  </p> <p>Conclusion: so, will I do this mod at my other Neos as well and can I recommend it? Yes, absolutely. I might try to get a gantry from the aftermarket which already offers the option for this kind of 3 point mounting system and which is (hopefully) more rigid overall though, as the whole gantry itself really appears pretty flimsy to me. I'm not sure about that yet though, as I like to tinker and modify it with spending the less money I can - but if I'll end up buying such a gantry, I'll add pictures here and let you know how it went.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#anycubic-leviq-20-automatic-bed-leveling-function","title":"Anycubic LeviQ 2.0 - Automatic Bed 'Leveling' Function","text":"<p>The printer comes with an automatic 25 point bed 'leveling' function called \"Anycubic LeviQ 2.0\".

Well - make sure to set up the printer as square and perpendicular as possible, tram your bed, tram your x-axis gantry and level the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#tramming-the-bed","title":"Tramming The Bed","text":"'Tramming' vs. 'Leveling' The Bed <p>Because I got attacked, harrassed, insulted and called names for using the correct term \"tramming\" instead of the misleading and technically wrong term \"leveling\", let me make something clear at this point.  </p> <p>What we do here is a procedure called \"tramming\".  We (try) to get the machine and certain parts of it aligned perfectly, like axes and parts being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant towards each other. For example, we try to set up the frame being mounted perfectly square, the z-axis frame being perpendicular to the base frame, the x-axis gantry being perpendicular to the z-axis frame and the bed being parallel and equidistant to the x-axis gantry and the printhead/nozzle. It's a technical term which is also used at CNC machines for example and this is the correct nomenclature. And as a matter of fact, this is also the case with 3d printers. Point.  </p> <p>\"Leveling\" though is the process of bringing something like a shelf, a table or a framed picture hanging at the wall into the position that it's perpendicular to gravity so to say. Most of the time you do so by taking a bubble level or a self-leveling laser. But this is NOT how you 'level' the bed of your 3d printer for example! </p> <p>Yes, I'm highly aware of the fact that the majority of the 3d printing community uses the term 'leveling', that people say \"Level your bed!\" and that the marketing guys and gals of the companies use the (even more misleading!) term \"Automatic Bed Leveling\" (which is even worse as it suggests that the process will actually 'level' the bed itself - which it obviously doesn't). But that doesn't mean that I have to follow that misleading road.  So besides the fact that this isn't the correct nomenclature (seriously, I'm not the grammar police - I'm a German guy who speaks a little bit of English..), my 'problem' with this term is that it's just really misleading!  </p> <p>How many beginners are pulling out their bubble level, put it on the bed or the x-axis gantry to check if it's leveled and maybe even shim out the table the printer stands on - just to come to the conclusion that their bed or gantry is leveled? Believe it or not: many - whether you came across those users while trying to help them or not. You can use a 3d printer on a tilted table - if the printer is trammed, it'll still print fine.   </p> <p>So to all those haters out there: yes, I will continue to use the correct term \"tramming\", no matter how much you'll attack and try to insult me. And no, I don't do it because I want to show the world that I know the correct term, I do it because I want to avoid that beginners become frustrated because they just get it wrong. And if you haters would start to actually do the same, then maybe one day there might occur a shift in the 'consciousness' of the community and the correct term would be used on a regular basis. Seriously, try to help people out by just using the correct term for making them realize that it's not about how perpendicular the bed or gantry is towards gravity - and stop harrassing people who already do so.  </p> <p>Even though \"tramming\" the bed isn't really possible when using the rigid stock spacers of the bedplate these printers come with, there is something one can and should do though: check if those spacers are all of the same height. This is really important, so better don't skip this step! </p> <p>If you're using adjustable spacers, then you'll be able to actually tram the bed itself.  </p> <p>If necessary, you can add Kapton tape on the magnetic surface of the bed underneath the PEI plate later to equalize warped or dented areas as much as possible. If you do so, make sure to check if the z-offset sensor still has the perfect height position!    </p> <p>I'll describe the belonging tramming process for each case in the following.  </p> \"Tramming\" When Using The Rigid Stock Spacers <p>When using the rigid stock spacers the printer came with, dismount the bedplate from the bedgantry and take out those four silver metal spacers. Then put them next to each other on a flat surface and/or measure them using a caliper. They might not be all of the same height, which will lead to a somewhat crooked, tilted or 'warped' bed.  </p> <p>Now you could either look for other spacers you might be using, put washers or other suitable material (e.g. gasket material) of the needed thickness under them when remounting or (what I'd recommend to do) sand them down to the smallest of the four spacers for achieving an equal height. When doing so, put the sandpaper on a flat surface and carefully rub the spacers across it - pay attention that you do this while holding the spacer absolutely perpendicular! You don't want to end up with a spacer where one end is sanded off tilted! </p> <p>Once you're done and all four spacers are of equal height, reassemble everything. Then proceed with tramming the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed.   </p> Tramming When Using Adjustable Spacers <p>You could also use adjustable spacers like silicone spacers or springs instead of those rigid spacers. That'll put you in the position of really being able to tram the bed. However, if doing so you not only need to be precise when tramming the bed, but you should proceed with tramming the x-axis gantry in relation to the frame first. This is really important as it will ensure that the x-axis gantry is parallel to the base frame. Once this step is done, you can proceed with tramming the bed itself.     </p> <p>When you want to tram the bed by adjusting the tension of the springs or silicone spacers to pull down a side or an edge of the bed, be careful to not bend the bed itself by tightening up just one corner too much. Try to push down one side of the bed and adjust two screws at a time.   I personally tram the bed by adding just a little bit of load to the spacers, so that the bed doesn't wobble.  </p> <p>For actually tramming the bed now, you'll have to move the printhead to all of the four corners and adjust the height of the belonging edge of the bed by tightening or loosening the belonging screw. I'd suppose to start with the left backhand corner and rotate clockwise. Take off the PEI plate and place an object onto the edge of the bed. It doesn't matter if this object is like 5mm or 5cm high as you're not setting the z-offset yet. It's just being used to ensure that the bedplate will be at the same height in relation to the printhead at all four corners. You need to make sure that you'll still be able to access the screw form the top though, so don't place the object right above the screw. Then lower the printhead manually until the nozzle or the ABL sensor just touches that object. Then move the object to the next corner and move the printhead across it. Make sure that you absolutely don't move the head along the z-axis by accident, so that you don't somehow change the height of it! If the head is positioned too low and there isn't enough space to fit the object between the bed and the head, tighten the screw for lowering the bedplate. If there's too much space, loosen the screw a bit until the nozzle/ABL sensor touches the object again. Proceed with the other corners like that. Once you're done with all four corners, do another round and check if everything still fits. Most likely it won't as it affects the other edges when adjusting the height of one edge. When you're done with this round as well, put on the PEI plate, move the lead screw manually for raising the head and place the object in the first corner again. Lower the head and check all four edges once again if everything is correct.  When you're done, make sure the screws won't turn themselves loose due to the vibration, so add e.g. an additional lock nut as well.     </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#probable-issue-broken-wiring","title":"Probable Issue: Broken Wiring","text":"<p>There's a probable (upcoming) issue which is worth getting it's own section: breaking wires of the bed's wiring. There are (besides the wiring for the aceleration sensor and the z-offset sensor) two types of wires at the bed: the thin ones which are the wires for the bed's thermistor and the thicker ones which are the wires for supplying the 24V DC to the coil at the underside of the bed for heating up the bed. Due to repetive motion and the design, these wires might start to break over time. To be more precise: the thin strands of the wires inside of the insulation start to break. Therefore the resistance of those wires will increase until the point is reached that all of the strands are broken and there's no contact given anymore.  </p> <p>This breaking of the wires is a common issue at the Kobra Go and Neo, but here at the Kobra 2 Pro it seems that Anycubic used slightly longer wires. So hopefully this will not be such a common issue, but I'll go a bit into detail here anyway, just in case this problem occurs.  </p> <p>In the beginning you'll most likely notice this when you have an error message appearing which tells you that the bedtemp is abnormal (I didn't come across the specific error message yet, so I can't tell you right now how exactly the message will be). Even though you can fix this issue by replacing the wires of the thermistor as described in the next sections, sooner or later this will also happen with the thicker wires. And even though this can be fixed as well by replacing the wires, it's not as easy 'detectable' as with the wring of the thermistor, as there won't be an error message if strands of the 24V wires start to break and therefore the resistance becomes bigger. Unfortunately this breaking of the 24V wires is a potential risk of a fire hazard though, as the wire will heat up at that particular spot where it starts to break - due to the increasing resistance and the higher current running through these wires compared to the wires of the thermistor. The more the wires break and the higher the resistance will become here, the hotter the wire will become as well - until the insulation might melt and (worst case) the whole wire starts catching fire.      </p> <p>So, besides keeping an eye on that during the regular maintenance you're doing, there might be something you could do to minimize the risk of premature breaking wires. Read the expandable textbox to see what I did to hopefully minimize the risk.  </p> <p>If you have to replace the wirings, I'd suggest to use slightly longer (and thicker) high-flex wires, as that'll allow a slightly bigger range of motion, assuming that it'll have a positive effect on the overall bending as well. In that case you might also think about routing the wires differently. Some people add wire chains, and even though it seems to be a good idea in general, you should pay attention to the bending radius of the chain as well as to the size of the chain itself. You don't want to squish the wires in there and you don't want to make them rub against each other or against the chain too much as well.  </p> <p>See the following sections for how to fix this problem.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#mod-wiring-harness-support","title":"MOD: Wiring Harness Support","text":"<p>The problem of breaking wires here is caused by the wires being too short in the first place, causing the effect that the wires will bend right behind that black plastic cap. So the first and best solution would be to either extend the existing wires or e.g. add an external MOSFET to the back of the printer's frame which then indirectly elongates the wiring as well.  </p> <p>However, even then the wires are prone to still start bending right behind the black plastic cap as well, even though the bending won't be as much 'hard' with longer wires than it would originally be.  </p> <p>To minimize this effect, I experimented with different solutions. The main goal for me here was to extend the bending area. As cablechains are having/causing different issues, I didn't go with those but experimented with some solutions you can easily make up yourself. I don't have that one and only final solution right now as I'm still experimenting with different mods at my Neos for testing what might be the best here. However, right now three simple 'hacks' seem to work - at least a bit, as I didn't run into the problem of broken wires here yet (..knock on wood..). To keep this section as short as possible, I'll go over each of them in an expandable textbox as usual.  </p> Duct-Tape <p>The first 'hack' is to actually just wrap some layers of duct tape around the plastic cap and the first inch or two of the wiring. By doing so, you'll stiffen up the wires a bit in that first section right behind the cap, avoiding the punctual bending. You need to make sure that the whole construction won't be too stiff as it should still be able to bend overall though, otherwise you'll provoke the same issue right after the attached tape. As I'm using my printers in an enclosure, this solution didn't last long though. The heat inside the enclosure made the glue of the tape warm and it lost contact to the black plastic cap. So I personally can't recommend this one.  </p> Self-Sealing/Welding Tape <p>The second 'hack' is actually kind of the same like the duct tape method, but instead of wrapping the self-sealing tape around the outside of the plastic cap, you wrap it around the wires. I forgot to take a picture of it, but it's fairly simple, so let me explain it a bit. - You cut the cabletie which holds the wire inside that plastic cap and take the whole wire harness thing out. - Then you wrap self-sealing tape around it, also in the area which will be inside of that cap later. So I'd say cover an area of about 2-3 inches with several layers, while applying more layers in the front part (towards that soldered contacts).   Make sure the wire is still able to easily bend in that area, you don't want to have it too stiff which would just lead to the circumstance that the sharp bending would occur right behind the taped area. - Now fiddle that wire back into place at the plastic cap like it was before and secure the position with a new cabletie. - That's it :)  </p> <p>For the sake of simplicity, I'd recommend this solution as it's easy to apply, even with the stock setup. If you don't know or have self-sealing / self-welding tape yet, give it a try. It's really great and comes in handy in several cases.   </p> Self-Sealing/Welding Tape And A Silicone Tube <p>The third option I tried is actually kind of similar to the one being previously mentioned, but instead of only using self-sealing tape, I used a piece of silicone tube in addition.  - First, I cut the cabletie which holds the whole wire 'package' to the black plastic cap. - Then I took a piece silicone tubing which I cut at one side and placed it across that specific section of the wire. - I then wrapped self-welding/sealing tape across it and secured everything again with a cabletie.   You can see this 'hack' at the following picture.     </p> <p>I have to admit though that I probably exxagerated it as the additional silicone tube made it quite stiff. So if you want to go with this solution, keep an eye on the thickness and stiffness of the tube as well as how many layers of tape you apply.    </p> Spring And Heat Shrink Tubings <p>The last method I'd like to mention is the one using a semi-stiff spring and some heat shrink tubings.  </p> <ul> <li>Disconnect the wires and pull the whole wiring harness through a semi-stiff spring as shown in the following picture. </li> <li>Then pull the wiring harness through a heat shrink tube which then goes in between the wires and the spring to avoid that the spring rubs on the wires and harms the insulation. </li> <li>Place the spring with the wires in the plastic cap and add a cabletie to hold it in place. </li> <li>Now pull the wires through a bigger heat shrink tube and place that one across the end of the spring and the wires that come out of it, to secure everything here. By doing so, you'll reduce the motion of the wires in the spring itself and stabilize the wire a bit. When the wires will be pulled/moved, they won't be bent at the spot right after the spring and won't be moved around in the spring as well.   The following picture shows the final asssembly. </li> </ul> <p>This is actually my preferred solution, BUT: you have to pay attention to use a spring which isn't too stiff! I had one laying around in my drawers at my workshop, so I can't give you any further specs. Best would be to check at a hardware shop and bend the spring to make sure it bends easily. You don't want to stiffen it up too much, you just want it to act as a guide for when the wires are being bent.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#checking-and-fixing-the-electric-circuit-and-the-thermistor","title":"Checking And Fixing The Electric Circuit And The Thermistor","text":"<p>If problems occur with the electric circuit or the thermistor, you can check each of them for localizing the cause of the error.

If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead.  </p> <p>However, it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity, because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the bed, as it leads to a higher resistance.  </p> <ul> <li>At the 24V wires this can lead to the circumstance that the wire will get hot at that spot, that the insulation will melt, that a shortcut might occur and it might even occur that it causes a fire.   </li> <li>At the thermistor wires this can cause the ERR: MINTEMP error message. When the problem of breaking strands starts to occur, you'll experience the upcoming of this error message when the bed is moving and reaches a certain position. In that case those broken strands lose contact, which leads to a suddenly changing resistance value.

If the temperature is lower, the resistance value will be higher; if the temperature is higher, the resistance value will be lower.

This will save you a lot of hassle, frustration and headaches later..  </p> <p>Seriously, I can't encourage you enough to do a complete check-up and maintenance of your printer before you even try to print the first time.  Not only will you get to know your printer better, it'll most likely save you headaches and many hours of fiddling around trying to find the perfect print settings - just to despair of weird artifacts showing up on prints just when you thought you found the perfect settings because they were caused by a sticky and partially clogged lead screw thread or so.   </p> <p>Get yourself a good carpenter's square in a 90\u00b0 rectangular angle. Make sure the tool itself actually really is square - especially the cheap ones being offered often lack of precision and aren't really square themself. When attempting to measure the parts of the frame and bring them into the correct position, always measure at both sides of the construction. By doing so you can mostly avoid any misalignments which might occur if only checking at one side and maybe not really paying attention to the parts of the rails which are further away. You can also strengthen the construction itself by adding certain coponents which make sure the construction is and stays in a rectangular position. It's also advisable to use some screw glue like Loctite, just to make sure screws won't come loose over time due to the vibrations of the machine.  </p> <p>Take your time setting up the frame of the printer (and the axes and wheels etc. after doing so as well), be as precise as you can be. Every misalignment here will most likely cause some weird issues later which might be hard to find or even solve if you're not remembering that maybe the construction itself might be the cause.   </p> <p>Just to show you what I'm talking about why it's really important to do so, look at the following pictures of the Y axis frame of the Kobra Neo.

Check the whole frame if everything is square, rectangular and perpendicular, check all screws, bolts, belts, wheels, electrical connectors - really just everything. And (really important): also disassemble the lead screw system, clean it and lubricate it and pay attention to vertical alignment when reassembling! </p> <p>You might think now \"Why should I waste my time with that? I got the machine preassembled and why should I even disassemble the lead screw system?!?\" - and I understand that. Sure, you want to dive right into the beautiful ocean of 3D printing. And you will. But as with jumping into the unknown ocean from a cliff high above, you need to assure that everything is safe. And in this case with your new 3D printer it's actually not only that. The point is: even if you got the machine preassembled, not everything might be assembled and mounted correctly. Some bolts or screws might not be tight enough or might be overtightened. The wheels might be too loose or too tight, same with the belts. And about the lead screw: just touch it. Does it feel kinda wet and oily, or does it feel more sticky and resinous instead? I'd bet it's more the last. And especially this will lead to a pretty quick wear out (in this case of the anti-backlash nut) and weird artifacts on your prints (due to the inconsistent movement) which will drive you crazy after hours of calibration prints.  </p> <p>So - lean back, read the specific chapters and then grab your tools.

It's a 32bit 24V mainboard with a GigaDevice MCU labeled as \"GD32F303\" which seems to be an ARM Cortex-M4 with 120MHz, 1024k Flash and 96k RAM.   </p> <p>It offers a microSD card reader, a USB-C connector and a 10 pin connector for adding the control unit.   The mainboard comes with TMC2208(?) silent stepper drivers soldered onto the board (so they can't be just swapped out!). </p> GC6609 stepper drivers being used as well! <p>It seems that Anycubic changed the stepper drivers from original TMC2208 to cheap 2208/2209 clones, called \"GC6609\". Thanks @kmars42 who came across this!  When exactly this change took place and whether it's a permanent solution or if only a certain batch of these mainboards have been populated with these kind of stepper drivers is unknown. It seems though that the mainboards which are equipped with these drivers are set up with silver heatsinkns instead of black heatsinks.   However, the following picture shows this stepper driver (you'd have to take off the heatsink to identify which specific type was being used at your mainboard - which I wouldn't recommend to do if you're just curious to know which one you have..).    </p> <p> </p> <p>I personally don't know anything about these drivers, but @aspiringnobody shared his knowledge and findings in this discussion. If you know anything more, please reach out and contribute to the discussion!  </p> <p> </p> <p>The microSD card reader slot and the USB-C connector can be accessed from at front of the printer, you find them at the right hand side of that black plastic aperture of the frame as shown in the picture below.  </p> <p> </p> Add Ferrules To The 24V Wires! <p>It's highly advisable to cut off the soldered tips of the wires without a plug (power supply and heated bed) and add ferrules to them. </p> <p>When you are screwing down the soldered tip inside the clamp, the solder will get cracked a bit and may get deformed a bit as well. When the wire gets warm due to the current and the solder gets softer, the contact may become loose which could lead to malfunction or even cause fire in the last consequence. So it's always a good idea to just use proper ferrules.  </p> Avoid Shortcuts! <p>Shortcuts coming from the cartridge heater for example can/will damage your mainboard, so be careful to never cause a shortcut somehow! </p> <p>A common misbehaviour is to clean the nozzle with a little brass brush during the print process or while everything is heating up. Also grabbing the heater block to e.g. change the nozzle while everything is heating up and electrical current is flowing is another common mistake. When using pliers to hold the heater block, the tips of the pliers may touch the contacts of the wires at the cartridge heater and you cause a shortcut. As a result you can/will get blown up part at the mainboard, like the melted part \"D4\" for example as shown in the picture below.  </p> <p>So always turn off the whole printer first to avoid a shortcut which will destroy your mainboard!</p> Use A USB Power Blocker <p>When connecting the printer to a computer or a Raspberry Pi, it is highly recommended to use an additional USB power blocker. By doing so, you make sure that neither the computer nor the mainboard will draw power through the USB-C connector from the other device. If you don't do so, it can harm your mainboard as well as your computer.  </p> <p>As it's an fast and easy solution, you can get a device called \"USB power blocker\" for a few bucks. Attention: make sure to not get a \"USB data blocker\" though, it has to be a power blocker! This device will then be plugged between the USB connector of the computer and the actual USB-C cable. It still allows data to be transferred, but the 5V line isn't existent. The following pictures show such a device and how it's installed.  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>However, you don't have to spend money on this item, as there are other ways to interrupt the 5V power line. For example, you can cut the 5V wire of your USB cable, you can solder a male and a female USB connector onto a little PCB and avoid making the 5V line connection or you can simply use some electric or Kapton tape and cover the belonging pin at the USB connector of the cable like shown in the following picture.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Keep in mind though that you have to pay attention that you only cover the 5V pin and that you have to make sure that the tape is still in place every time you plug in the cable after you unplugged it.  </p> Red Glue Across All Connectors <p>When you look at the mainboard, you'll see some red glue spread across all connectors. That's just for securing the connnection. You can get that stuff off by carefully pulling it off. It works better if you warm up that stuff a little bit for making it more flexible, a hair dryer is good for that. It then becomes a bit softer and easier to be pulled off. Don't heat it up too much though as it'll become too soft then! You can also use a thin screwdriver to lift up a part of that stuff and then use some tweezers to grab it.    </p> <p>However, be very careful to  </p> <ul> <li>not harm the mainboard by slipping off with the screwdriver or tweezer!  </li> <li>not overheat the mainboards of parts of it when heating up that red glue!  </li> <li>not rip off the heatsinks of the stepper drivers!   This can happen really quick as they're just glued onto the stepper drivers with some thermal paste and the red glue is usually spread across the fins of the heatsinks as well!   So if you have to pull off that stuff from those connectors of the motor wiring, then make sure that you press down the heatsink with your finger when trying to pull that stuff off! </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/mainboard/#mainboard-cooling-fan","title":"Mainboard Cooling Fan","text":"<p>The following picture shows the fan of the mainboard.

Even though the MOSFET on the mainboard is sufficient, it's an upgrade worth doing as it not only leads to the fact that the bed will be heated up slightly faster, but it also increases the security of the hole printer. The MOSFET of the mainboard doesn't have a heatsink and it may caused by overheating due to an excessive amount of current being drawn, especially when using higher bed temperatures. Due to the low clearance between the fan of the moainboard and the ground the printer stands on, the cooling isn't the best as well. When using an enclosure which then heats up as well, cooling gets even worse. If the board's MOSTFET dies, you most likely have to get a whole new mainboard then. Even though it's possible to solder a new one onto the board (if you're skilled to do that), additional components might have been harmed. To avoid that, it's therefore adviseable to add an external MOSFET which then takes the load - the one on the mainboard only acts as a signal for the external one to switch.  </p> <p>The 24V DC of the PSU will be connected to the belonging connector of the external MOSFET.

When the mainboard switches the onboard MOSFET, it will then trigger the external one to switch and lead the current to the heated bed. There are a few external MOSFETs on the market, most of them only have a \"signal\" connector. When using a mainboard with a dedicated 'signal' connector for this, it's then connected to that one.

If you'd know the weight of the empty spool, you could (more or less precise) calculate the amount in meters left on the spool by just putting the spool on a kitchen scale.  </p> <p>So if you have a favoured brand and an empty spool already, measure the weight of it and keep it in mind (or on a Post-It note ;) ). But what if you don't have an empty spool you could measure? In that case I have your back covered - check out this Wiki which lists many brands and the weights of the belonging spools. (If your specific type isn't listed, please reach out to the creators of that Wiki once your spool is empty and you were able to get the specific weight!)  </p> Calculating The Amoung Of Filament <p>It's said that a regular 1kg spool of 1.75mm filament contains about 330m of filament. To be on the safe side, I personally calculate with 300m per 1kg. That means 1000g = 300m, 100g = 30m and 10g = 1m. So when you wanna roughly calculate the amount of filament left on the spool before or even while printing, put the spool on a kitchen scale and read the weight. Then substract the spool's weight and you have the amount of filament left in grams. Convert that to meters and you'll get an idea if you're on the safe side or if you should have a new spool on hand.  </p> <p>Example: I'm using AzureFilm filament which comes with the newer spool design, those black ones with the holes. The spool's weight is 220g. The actual spool's weight with some filament left on there is 390g. So we can do the math: 390-220=170 - ok, so I have 170g filament on there. How many meters are that now? 100g of filament is about 30m, 10g about 3m. So: 30+(7*3)=51 - means, I have about 51m filament left on the spool, which would allow me to start my 3hrs print which uses 27m without the need to worry if I'll run out of filament. </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#spool-holder","title":"Spool Holder","text":"<p>The spool holder is mounted to the left side of the base frame.  </p> <p>Some people change the position and mount the spool holder to the top of the frame (you can find models for doing so at e.g. Printables.com and Thingiverse.com). However, due to the construction of the frame itself, the additional weight being put on top of it, the resulting impact of the (changing) weight on vibrations while printing (especially at this high-speed type of printer) and because of the poor roll-off behavior of the spool itself, I personally wouldn't do so. If you want to get rid of the stock spool holder mounted to the side due to the additional width of the hole printer setip, I'd suppose to use a spool holder solution which isn't attached to the printer itself and which uses ball bearings as well.  </p> Boxed Spool Holder <p>If you'd use a box with a lid which closes really well (best would be this kind of plastic box with the silicone sealing in the lid) and put a bag of desiccant in the box as well, you could also can keep the filament dry and dust-free. Just print yourself one of those ball bearing spool holders where you place the spool onto, drill a hole in the side of the box and feed the filament through. Then place it next to the printer or onto a shelf above it and you're good. Putting one of these cheap digital hygrometers in the box as well helps keeping an eye on the actual humidity inside of the box.  </p> <p>I personally used a cakebox with a lid which I mounted to an adjustable construction to the wall (because I couldn't get my hands on a decent box and ran across that cheap cakebox, so I couldn't resist). The spool itself is held by a bolt with some ball bearing spool holder. Of course I put a bag of desiccant and a cheap hygrometer in there as well. This solution isn't as air-tight as a box with a silicone sealed lid, but it does the job in my room fine. Plus, it keeps dust and my cats away from the filament as well.  </p> <p> |  </p> <p>At the printers which are located in an enclosure, I use one of those 4l cereal containers (see the section \"Filament Storage\" below) with a custom lid and a spool holder mechanism to feed the filament.  </p> Influence Of The Spool's Weight On Vibrations <p>I personally don't like the spool being attached to the top of the frame. Even though I do see the 'value' of it in saving space around the printer, I personally think that adding 1kg (or even 2kg as some people mount a second one on top as well) to this kind of construction isn't the best idea. Especially not at these high-speed style bedslingers.    </p> <p>The construction itself isn't the most rigid one anyway, and the higher the x-axis gantry rises along the z-axis, the stronger the vibrations become which are caused by the moving parts. Adding another kilogram or even more to the top now will enhance this effect, which will become even bigger when printing with higher speeds. Plus, the changing weight of the spool (due to the filament being used) causes a changing pattern of these vibrations.  </p> <p>By using Klipper and the Input Shaper functionality, we can measure the vibrations and apply certain algorithms to compensate them (which is somehow implemented -up to a certain degree- in the stock firmware as well). But due to the fact that the patterns of these vibrations alter with the changing weight of the spool(s), it's kinda counterproductive to mount the spool(s) on top. As I didn't had an empty and a full spool to test the vibrations for investigating this problem, a friend of mine was so kind to run these tests.

Since some sorts of filament like PETG, TPU and Nylon are prone to take up moisture more than others (like PLA), you often need to actively dry it to avoid printing problems like artifacts and heavy stringing. Using a fresh spool which comes right out of the sealed bag from the manufacturer isn't a guarantee for dry filament as well, since moisture is often being taken up during the cooling process when manufacturing it. The following picture shows the skirt of a fresh spool of high quality filament - on the left it's straight out of the sealed bag, on the right it's after being dried.  </p> <p></p> <p>To actively dry filament, you need to heat up the entire spool for a few hours and let the mositure evaporate. You can either do so by using a dedicated filament dryer, a modified food dehydrator or just the heated bed of your printer. You should not use your kitchen oven though! </p> <p>Whichever solution you use in the end, you have to make sure that the temperature for drying does fit the specific type of filament, and that you never reach the glass transition temperature. You can find various charts across the web where temperatures and times are being listed one should use for drying.

However, if you're looking out for a filament dryer, you should check for two things: 1) Check the maximum temperature the device can generate. This is especially important if you want to dry filaments which need higher temperatures. 2) Make sure to get yourself a dryer which comes with an inbuilt fan, so that the hot air can circulate in the drier. Cheap units often lack a fan and just have a heating element at the bottom. This then leads to the problem that the bottom of the spool gets warm (or even too hot) while the upper part of the spool doesn't reach the desired filament.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#food-dehydrator","title":"Food Dehydrator","text":"<p>I personally use a food dehydrator since they're intended to dry food and herbs, come with a built in fan already and are usually also cheaper than a 'dedicated' filament drier.

On there, you put the spool flat/horizontally (= not standing upright) and then put a cardboard box over the spool. Make sure both the spool and the cardboard box are resting on the wooden sticks to allow circulation of the air. Poke some holes in the top of the cardboard box to allow that the moisture can evaporate.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#filament-storage","title":"Filament Storage","text":"<p>Storing your filament in a way that it's not only protected from dust and UV light, but also from moisture is the way to go. As always, you have plenty of options. You could put the used spool back in a bag and vaccum and seal it, use re-usable plastic bags with a zipper and a hole for using a pump to create a vaccum, put all of your spools in a big box which is as much sealed as possible or use individual sealed containers for each spool - just to name a few. After doing some tests with different storage solutions and measuring the humidity over time, I personally decided to go with the last option I just mentioned - and after observing the stability of the humidity and the filament, I really can recommend it. So let me go a bit into details about it.  </p> <p>I got myself some of those sealed cereal containers in the size of 4l (size is about ). The 1kg spools fit in there perfectly (at least the ones I tested - I didn't test the brands with those spools made from cardbox though and therefore I don't know if those may vary in the size), 2kg spools don't fit. These containers come with a sealed lid you can clip on the container. I printed a little mount for those cheap rectangular hygrometers and printed a mini spool holder as well, just to keep the spool in place a bit better (this isn't necessary though). I then also bought a big amount of silica gel (desiccant) and put 200g of it into some thin lady socks (I also tested those small packages which come with the spools, but those ones just don't take enough moisture imho). I got the orange version of the silica gel which turns to a dark green when being moist (don't get the stuff that turns blue as that's toxic) as it makes it easier to judge by a quick glance if the desiccant is still good to use. Adding some labels to the box helps identifying the different types of filament without the need to open the box and thake out the spool. I didn't type the colour, as I'm able to identify that through the box.  </p> <p>So, adding that 200g bag into an empty container got the humidity down to 10%. That was stable across time. After adding a fresh spool right out of the sealed bag, the humidity usually raised up to something between ~40-50%, which then dropped down to 10% again over time. This value was stable then over time. In my opinion this method doesn't only keep the humidity inside of the container low but it also dries the filament over time.   </p> <p>The following picture shows a setup like that.  </p> <p></p> <p>I designed a cap/insert for the lid's opening as I couldn't find any model that fit the specific triangle-like shaped opening. I made it in different variants, like with and without a hole to feed the filament through and with and without a cutout for the typical cheap hygrometer/thermometer units. The following picture shows one of those caps which I personally am using to feed filament right out of the container, it's the version with the hygrometer/thermometer unit and the 4mm hole.  </p> <p> </p> <p>You can find the models here: Caps/inserts for the lids of 4l cereal containers (filament storage &amp; feeding filament), 'triangle' shaped type  If you want to feed the filament right out of the box, I'd suggest to add a ball bearing mount for holding the spool. If you don't have any other feeding system, then I'd suggest to modify one of those containers for this purpose. You can also find guides about this solution and find models for printing different mounting solutions.  </p> Types Of Filament <p>The following article gives you a nice overview of the different types of filament available and what they're being used for: Best 3D Printer Filament: The Main Types in 2023</p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#printer-enclosure","title":"Printer Enclosure","text":"<p>Using an enclosure has clear advantages and is even necessary for succesfully print certain types of filament. However, it might cause some problems as well. So here are a few things I'd like to mention about enclosures in general.   </p> <p>Let's talk about the downsides first, as there are only a few:   </p> <ul> <li>When you're only printing PLA, an enclosure which traps the heat might be counterproductive. PLA needs a proper cooling, therefore a heated chamber can cause some thermal issues like insufficient cooling of the printed parts. So when you're printing PLA and using an enclosure, it's best if you leave the enclosure as open as possible.  </li> <li>An enclosure usually takes more space than the printer itself just standing somewhere. You need additional space in the enclosure for being able to reach certain parts of the hardware comfortably.  </li> <li>The trapped heat in an enclosure puts some additional thermal stress on the printer itself. The active cooling of parts like the mainboard, the PSU, the heatsink and the printed part itself won't be as sufficient as if the the printer won't be trapped in a heated chamber. Besides that, motors might get hotter and parts like the POM wheels and the belts might be negatively affected by the heat as well. Depending on the design and size of the enclosure and the temperatures of the bed and the hotend being used for printing, the temperature inside of an enclosure can easily reach 40\u00b0C.  </li> <li>The risk of a fire hazard might be higher. Especially when using flammable material for building the enclosure.  </li> </ul> <p>The upsides though can clearly make up the beforementioned issues:  </p> <ul> <li>Your machine is protected from dust, pet hair and so on.  </li> <li>Depending on the design of the enclosure, you'll achieve a reduction of the noises and the fumes.  </li> <li>Printing certain types of filament will not only become easier (like PETG for example which is already pretty sensitive to a cool airstream hitting the bed), some even require the usage of an enclosure, like ABS for example.  </li> <li>You can integrate certain security functions like a smoke detector and even a fire distinguisher, which can reduce the risk of a fire hazard massively.   This is highly dependant on the material the enclosure is built from though - if you're using highly flammable material for insulating the inner parts of the enclosure or if you're building the enclosure from wood, then of course the whole enclosure itself will increase the risk as mentioned above. So make sure you're using proper material.  </li> </ul> <p>When thinking about using an enclosure, you'd have to think about the design itself, the size and the materials. If you have no idea to start from, you can find countless solutions as an inspiration across the web (a pretty popular and easy to build solution is the \"IKEA Lack enclosure\"). There are also prebuilt enclosures available as well as enclosures which I personally call \"tent style enclosures\" (or just \"tents\").  </p> <p>I personally ended up with getting myself two of those tent style enclosures, just because I like the idea of being able to fold it together and put it in the closet if I don't need it anymore. There are quite a few of these tents available, but when taking a closer look at the various offers you'll see that most of them are actually the same, just being branded differently. I call them \"generic\" ones. Only some of the tents available on the market seem to really differ from those \"generic\" ones, here the ones from Creality and SainSmart have to be mentioned as you'll most likely come across them when you're searching for these tent style enclosures. I got myself one of those \"generic\" ones which was branded by Sunlu and one from SainSmart which I'll show in the following and mention some pros and cons I personally consider worth mentioning. I didn't get the one fromm Creality as it was the narrowest among those offers (width ~47.5cm) - even though it would be sufficient and the printer would fit in there (without the spool holder being mounted to the side), I personally like a bit of additional space as I often get my hands on the hardware anyway and therefore won't need to always take the printer out of the enclosure when choosing a slightly wider tent.  </p> <p>Spool Holder</p> <p>With the regular sized tents like the ones being shown in the following, you can't use the stock spool holder being mounted to the left side of the frame. However, there's enough space to either put the spool on a custom spool holder you printed and placed next to the printer or you can also mount the spool to the top of the frame. The latter isn't really adviseable though, especially if you want to print with high speeds, as the additional and changing weight at the top does have an altering influence on the vibrations.</p> <p>Sunlu (imho \"generic\" type of tent) The size of this generic tent style enclosure one is about 55x64x74cm. Due to it's height, the enclosure allows the usage of a filament spool holder mounted to the top of the frame.    </p> Sunlu closed Sunlu open <p>When looking at the generic tent which in my case was branded by Sunlu, it hits the eye right away how thin the material actually is. The 'aluminum' is applied as some sort of sprayed on layer, there is no insulation between the outer material and the aluminum foil at the inside as there's just one layer of material.  If you place a lamp inside the enclosure, you can see the light shining through the material (in the picture of the closed tent above you can see some bright spots within the black material at the outside - this is the aluminum coating shining through the outer material!) - I think this already speaks for itself. As expected, the insulating effect on noise, temperatures and fumes therefore is only small. The zipper isn't covered in any way and it doesn't appear to be made of a high quality anyway. The rods are made from fibreglas, the parts where the rods are being stuck into are made from plastic. The following pictures show some close-up views of the material and the zipper.  </p> Zipper Material <p>You can open that front door completely all across the top. There's an additional opening at the left side which allows accessing the machine or feeding filament from outside - keep in mind though that this will lead to the fact that the heat won't be trapped inside anymore and airstreams could hit the bedplate. On the right side some pocketss for storing smaller parts are applied.  The following picture shows the left side of the enclosure with the part which can be opened.   </p> <p></p> <p>I personally used this enclosure for one of my Kobra Neos which I use for only printing PLA. When printing, I completely opened it. When not printing, this enclosure acted as a protection against dust and hairs of my cats. However, due to the fact that the following enclosure from SainSmart is just so much better, I ended up getting more of those and stowed away this thin generic one in my closet.</p> <p>If you're planning on using this type of tent in a really dusty environment though, like in a workshop where you also work with wood or so, I'd strongly recommend to get yourself the tent from SainSmart (see below) instead as the zipper and the whole material is made of a much better quality.   </p> <p>UPDATE: I gave this one away to a friend and got myself some more of the SainSmart enclosures when they were on sale. The quality is just outstanding compared to the 'generic' one I showed. </p> <p>SainSmart \"Upgraded Large Volume 3D Printer Enclosure\"  The size of this tent style enclosure from SainSmart one is about 54x62x72cm. Due to it's height, the enclosure allows the usage of a filament spool holder mounted to the top of the frame.  </p> SainSmart closed SainSmart open <p>When looking at the tent, you can tell the much better quality right away. The material itself isn't only thicker and more dense, it also consists different layers. There is the outer material, then you have some sort of foam insulation and an aluminum foil covering the inside. This results in a much better reduction of the noise and fumes and traps the heat inside the enclosure better as well. The risk of a fire hazard should be reduced much more significantly than at the generic tent, as we have a 'real' aluminum layer here instead of just some sort of sprayed-on aluminum-looking substance.  The zippers seem to be made of a better quality as well and they're somewhat covered. The rods of the frame are made from metal, the pieces where the rods get stuck in are plastic as well though.  The following pictures show some close-up views of the zipper and the material where you can clearly see the foam padding.   </p> Zipper Material <p>The front door can be opened all across the top as well and there is an additional opening at the top which can be used while the tent is closed. On the left side some pocekts for storing smaller parts are applied as well as some belts for e.g. hanging up filament spools. On the right side there's an additional oopening as well which allows you to access the machine from the side.  </p> Left side Top side Right side <p>Due to the better quality, I personally used this tent for one of my Kobra Neos which only prints other types of filament than PLA in the first place. But because the quality is just so much better than the quality of the generic one mentioned above, I ended up getting more of these enclosure from SainSmart and only use these ones now. Compared to the generic one, it's really impressive how much quieter the printer is and how much better the fumes are being kept iniside.  </p> <p>UPDATE: I gave the 'generic' one away to a friend and got myself some more of the SainSmart enclosures when they were on sale. The quality is just outstanding compared to the 'generic' one I showed. I even got myself more than I actually needed - just in case I'll get another machine. My cat loves them as well - she immediately seized the packages when I was setting up a new one..  </p> <p> </p> <p>Final thoughts on tent style enclosures My bottom line here about these two types of tent style enclosures would be: if you plan to use the enclosure for printing more demanding types of filament like ABS for example and not just like using it as a better dust protection cover, then I highly recommend getting the one from SainSmart. The difference in quality compared to the \"generic\" one from Sunlu shown above is like day and night and it's really impressive how much quieter the printer is and how much better the fumes are being kept inside with the enclosure from SainSmart compared to the generic one.   The enclosure from SainSmart usually is a bit more expensive that the cheapest generic ones you could get, but the much better quality is worth every buck. Sure, the generic one also works, and I used it for printing PETG as well (where using an enclosure isn't necessary, but it helps avoiding any cold airstream hitting the bed) as it was the first tent I got myself. When I then got the one from SainSmart and the difference in quality became obvious, I kind of did regret spending the money on the generic one though as it was only 20\u20ac less than the one from SainSmart.  </p> <p>However, due to the fact that the stock spool holder is mounted to the left side and the whole printer setup therefore gets wider, it most likely won't fit in these tent style enclosures anymore without using a different solution for the spool holder (I didn't check that yet as I'm not using the stock spool holder). It might be that the generic tents could be used when the lid on the left side is opened and the spool sticks out of the enclosure. As the one from SainSmart has the opening on the right side, this wouldn't be possible with that one then. Doing so might be counterproductive though, as the enclosure won't be closed anymore and a cold airstream might hit the bed. This wouldn't be a problem if you're only PLA anyway, but it would become a problem when printing more demanding types of filament which are sensitive to this. There are bigger tents available on the market es well, but of course that would come with the need of decent space to put them. So I personally would suggest to use a solution where the spool is held by a different type of spool holder, like using one of those abovementioned 4l cereal containers where you added a mechanism to feed the filament from. This also has the advantage that the humidity inside of the container can be held down (by adding a bag of silica gel) which serves those types of filament which tend to take up moisture faster than PLA (like PETG and TPU).  </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"hardware/powersupply/","title":"Power Supply Unit","text":""},{"location":"hardware/powersupply/#power-supply-unit","title":"Power Supply Unit","text":"Specifications Input Voltage: 115V and 230V AC (choose the correct voltage by setting a switch before turning on the printer!)

Even though the MOSFET on the mainboard is sufficient, it's an upgrade worth doing as it not only leads to the fact that the bed will be heated up slightly faster, but it also increases the security of the hole printer. The MOSFET of the mainboard doesn't have a heatsink and it may caused by overheating due to an excessive amount of current being drawn, especially when using higher bed temperatures. Due to the low clearance between the fan of the moainboard and the ground the printer stands on, the cooling isn't the best as well. When using an enclosure which then heats up as well, cooling gets even worse. If the board's MOSTFET dies, you most likely have to get a whole new mainboard then. Even though it's possible to solder a new one onto the board (if you're skilled to do that), additional components might have been harmed.

When using a mainboard that doesn't have this 'signal' connector like the one being used at these printers, then it's said to connect the 24V from the bed's connector of the mainboard to that.  </p> <p>I personally prefer a certain type of MOSFET which also offers a dedicated connector for the 24V line besides the 'signal' connector as shown in the following picture.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The PSU and the wiring of the bedplate are connected to the belonging connectors shown in the following picture: 24V from the PSU belongs to the connector labeled as \"Power\", the 24V for the wiring of the bedplate belongs to the connector \"Hotbed\".  </p> <p> </p> <p>The 24V of the bed's connector of the mainboard will then be connected to the belonging connector \"Bed\" at the MOSFET (positioned next to the connector labeled as \"Sig\").  </p> <p> </p> <p>If you're using this kind (or a different kind) of MOSFET, you should check if the manufacturer actually added some thermal paste between the MOSFET and the heatsink - it wasn't the case at the ones I got as shown in the picture below, so that actually completely counteracts the whole installation and makes it obsolete.  </p> <p></p> <p>Mind The Polarity</p> <p>Pay attention to the polarity when connecting the components!  </p> <p>Add An Additional Fuse</p> <p>It is highly recommended to add a suitable fuse to the 24V line, right after the connector of the PSU.

The main reason for that is to melt the filament which most likely entered little gaps there. Usually it's said that it should be around 200\u00b0C but that's probably not sufficient because (in my opinion) it depends on the material of the filament. So my suggestion is to heat up the extruder about 5-10\u00b0C more than the temperature you're printing with, then you should be on the safe side.  So either do that using the pre-heat function of the printer or by using a sufficient heat gut.

So please don't try to loosen the nozzle with a pair of pliers for example, use e.g. a wrench for that.  I also strongly recommend to not use a pair of pliers for the heater block, also for that you should use a wrench (if you don't have one of that size, use an adjustable one).

Then carefully push down that cap while paying attention that it really goes across the plug in the back as well.

If you still can't get your filament loaded, it's most likely that the PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged or deformed or that you have a clog in or above the nozzle somewhere. To clean, inspect and maintain it, you need to disassemble the hotend. Check the section \"Disassembling The Hotend\" further down below for more information.   </p> Retraction Settings <p>Make sure that you set the retraction distance and speed to the correct values for a direct drive in conjuction with a Volcano nozzle! In general, it's supposed to be something around 1mm retraction distance for direct drive systems, when using a Volcano nozzle you should be fine going up to 2mm. A bit more might work well also, but you don't want to risk pulling the hot and melted filament up in the cold zone of the heatbreak, so don't exxagerate increasing the retraction distance. Play around with the retraction speed as well, as the speed which is being used to actually retract the filament plays an important role as well. You can find some more information about this topic in the section \"Retraction Settings\".</p> Feeder Gear Pressure <p>When adjusting the pressure of the feeder gear, make sure you don't tighten it up too much as it could squeeze and deform the filament. On the other hand it shouldn't be too loose though as it should transport the filament reliably. The following picture shows you the location of the screw for adjusting the feeder gear tension. </p> <p>When pulling out the filament of the extruder system, you should notice little dents on the surface of the filament from the teeth of the feeder gear, the filament itself shouldn't be squeezed and deformed though, it should still be \"round\" so to say. You don't want the feeder gear to \"bite\" too much into the filament as well though, as this may lead to inconsistentites of the filament flow. I personally like to extrude a bit so that the gear actually has to pull it in. Then I do a cold pull and check the marks of the gear on the filament itself. If you can see and feel little marks of the teeth of the gear on the surface of the filament, then it should be ok. If you don't feel and see any marks, then it's too loose. PLA is pretty hard, so the pressure can/should be a bit higher as well, but if the marks are pretty deep, then it already might be too much. If the filament is already a bit squeezed and kinda flat, then it's definitely way too much pressure (you'll most likely experience some weird artefacts, inconcisties and patterns at your prints as well then).  The filament should be fed reliably, which especially comes into account while retracting. So keep an eye on the shaft of the motor by looking at the back of the motor - if you notice that it's slipping while retracting, you definitely need to increase the tension. As a rule of thumb you can keep in mind that the pressure should be higher when using hard filament like PLA and lower when using soft filament like TPU.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/printhead/#disassembling-the-feeder-gear","title":"Disassembling The Feeder Gear","text":"<p>If problems with the feeder gear occur, you have to open the feeder gear box or even disassemble the whole system for cleaning, further inspections or replacing certain parts.

Don't use a screwdriver or something like that to do so as you might harm the wires and/or cause a shortcut at e.g. the contacts of the cartridge heater. Be really careful when taking away the clumps to not harm or rip off any of the wires! You can also use a cloth to wipe off the melted filament from the heater block and so on, just make sure you don't burn yourself!  </li> <li>For the next steps you need to be a bit quick in proceeding them, so if this is the first time you're diassembling the hotend, take a look at the sections here at the page and read them first so you'll know where the screws are located and which steps you need to take. Then proceed with the following steps.</li> <li>So, once everything is as clean as possible, heat everything up again. The turn off the printer and loosen the two grub screws inside the heater block to take out the thermistor and the cartridge heater.

Pay special attention to all the threads and the holes of the heater block where the thermistor and the cartridge heater will take place. If you don't get everything cleaned up at the first time, just put it back in the acetone, wait again and then repeat the cleaning steps. </li> <li>Once everything looks nice and clean, rinse off the acetone with clear water and let it dry.

Besides that, I personally think that friction might be added when using a reverse bowden. I also think that it might happen that there's different tension on the filament when the extruder moves around and when e.g. it's pushing back filament in certain positions, which imho might lead to differencies of the filament volume per extruder steps. This especially might come into place and cause issues when printing softer material like TPU.   I might be completely wrong with my assumptions though, so don't take my thoughts on this as being correct! Either just use the reverse bowden when changing the position of your spool or do some research about this topic on your own. I didn't really dive into this topic any further yet, but I most likely will do so anywhere in the future.   </p> <p>Reverse bowden tubes do have some advantages though, as they constrain the distance between their mounting point at the frame and the extruder.

Search for \"Kobra 2 hotend\" as those are the same being used.   </p> What Is A 100k NTC Thermistor? <p>A thermistor is an electronical part which changes resistances depending on the given temperature, the resistance will then be interpreted as a temperature reading. The thermistor being used is a 100k Ohm NTC type. That means, that it has a resistance of about 100k Ohm at 25\u00b0C temperature. When the temperature drops, the resistance will become higher/bigger. When the temperature rises, the resistance will become lower/smaller. As an example: at 20\u00b0C the resistance is about 125k Ohm; at 30\u00b0C the resistance is about 81k Ohm. Therefore you can measure the functionality of the thermistor by measuring the given resistance with a multimeter.

You'll risk a shortcut which then will harm your motherboard and might even cause more severe damage!  </p> <p>Generally speaking, you can check the wiring of the thermistor by measuring the electrical continuity of the wires. If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead. However, it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity, because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the head, as it leads to a higher resistance and therefore a wrong temperature being reported.  </p> <p>The difficulty here though is to actually measure one wire by itself, because you can only access one end of the wire (at the connector), the other end is inside of the thermistor's capsule. So if you measure the resistance probing at both contacts of the two wires, you already measure the thermistor itself as well.  However, by doing so you could still be able to tell if the wiring is faulty when you move the wires around while probing and see if the resistance value will spontaneously change. It actually wouldn't really help you in the end though to know if it's either the wiring or the thermistor itself, as you can't just change the wiring. Due to the construction of the thermistor and it's wiring, you'd have to replace the whole unit anyway though.  </p> Measuring / Checking The Thermistor <p>You can check if a thermistor is working or if it's somehow broken by measuring the resistance of it using a multimeter. As mentioned above, at a temperature of 25\u00b0C the resistance should be ~100k Ohm (nominal restistance: R25\u00b0C = 100 k\u03a9 \u00b1 1%). If the temperature is lower, the resistance value will be higher; if the temperature is higher, the resistance value will be lower. The following table gives you some typical resistance values of a 100K thermistor type 3950 (generic) for temperatures around room temperature.

If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead.     However, it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity, because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the head, as it leads to a higher resistance.

This also involves hardened steel nozzles! Referring to the manufacturers, the coating might be harmed when doing so.     </li> </ul> About Nozzles In General <ul> <li> <p>Do yourself a favour and don't buy those cheap brass nozzles where you'll get a dozen of them for a few bucks. It's just not worth it. Remember that the nozzle is pretty much the most crucial part when it comes down to printing and achieving good results, as it's the last link in the chain of the print process and puts out the filament - so go for an established manufacturer who is known for producing quality nozzles.   Means, avoid those cheap sets of nozzles where you get a dozen nozzles for a few bucks. Those often lack quality: the bore might be off-center and/or might have a burr (which leads to heavy stringing), the thread might not be precise (which leads to leaking) and so on.   I personally only use original E3D Volcano nozzles. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than the super cheap ones, but it's still a good price and it's really worth it - they last longer, they're precisely made and you'll get much better results. As long as you don't want to print special abrasive filaments, you're always good with the standard E3D V6 brass nozzles.  </p> </li> <li> <p>If you want to print filaments that are more abrasive, you probably want to go with nozzles made from plated copper, stainless or hardened steel, ruby sapphire nozzles and so on. Check out the web for further and more specific information about what to choose.   Be aware of the fact though, that the manufacturers clearly advise against doing cold pulls with any kind of coated nozzles! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! Referring to them, the coating might be harmed when doing so.  </p> </li> </ul> About Nozzle Sizes <p>When it comes down to choose the right nozzle size, it all depends on what you want to print and how detailed it should be. The standard size of 0.4mm the printers come with is a good starting point. However, you may find yourself in the situation that you want to print more detailed objects or objects which should be more sturdy or where it doesn't matter if the surface doesn't look as clean and flat as possible, so you probably should adjust the size and switch to a smaller oder bigger diameter like 0.2mm for high detailed objects and 0.6mm for the 'rougher' prints.  Keep in mind though that the printing time usually increases by choosing a smaller diameter and it decreases when you're using a bigger diameter. The printing time as well as the quality also depends on the layer height you're using, so by choosing a smaller layer height you can also get detailed and great looking prints with a 0.6mm nozzle. Last but not least a smaller nozzle bore is more likely to clog and some filaments even have a sticker on the spool saying that e.g. it should be printed with minimum a 0.4mm nozzle. So choose wisely if you really want to use a nozzle with a 0.2mm bore for example.  </p> <p>Search the web for more specific information about finding and choosing the right nozzle size for your project. You may want to start with this article from All3DP: The Best 3D Printer Nozzle Types, Sizes &amp; Materials.  </p> <p>In the following I'll mention some aspects you should be aware of when choosing a different nozzle size, particularly when choosing a bigger nozzle. Most people seem to be stuck to the common 0.4 nozzle and don't seem to be aware of the fact that one can still get 'fine' detailed outcomes (more or less - of course there's a difference in the ability of printing super fine details when e.g. comparing a 0.2 to a 0.6 nozzle..) or 'even' surfaces with a bigger nozzle size as well if e.g. going with the same layer height. The increased line width helps cutting down the printing time and makes prints even more rigid.   </p> <p>For testing around just copy your existent profile and change the nozzle size in there. Save it as an own profile and start playing around. </p> <ul> <li>Printing temperature: when using a bigger nozzle, one needs to keep an eye on the printing temperature. The bigger the nozzle is, the more filament will flow thru the bore at the same time - and therefore less time it has to completely melt so to say. So instead of using the same temp like with the 0.4 nozzle, increase the temperature. How much that has to be depends on the diameter of the nozzle, the type of filament etc - so maybe start with increasing 5\u00b0C or 10\u00b0C and see how it turns out.  </li> <li>Printing speed: the same as for the printing temp. Generally speaking, the faster you want to print, the hotter you have to print as well to compensate/reach the higher flowrate and have the same amount melted in the same time. I often see ppl going with e.g. 190-200\u00b0 for PLA and trying to print at the max speeds the new K2 models can reach - that most likely doesn't work. Instead, increase the temp and/or decrease the speed.  </li> </ul> <p>For both of these points there are somewhat limitations tho, so when e.g. printing small and thin parts you'll most likely run into issues when printing too fast as well as when printing too hot, as the material might not have enough time to cool down properly and therefore curls up or behaves weird in other ways. One can try to compensate that (besides choosing the suitable speed&amp;temp) by making use of the minimum layer time settings in the slicer.  </p> <ul> <li>Retraction settings: you need to keep an eye on and dial in your retraction settings when using a bigger nozzle size. Try different retraction speed settings as well, not only retraction distance.  </li> <li>Use the Arachne feature in your Slicer - Prusa has it and iirc also Cura has it.   That being said, when using a bigger nozzle, you might want to check if it makes sense to add one or two more walls. As most of the models are somewhat designed for being printed with the common 0.4 nozzle, I found that this comes into account when choosing the amount of walls and the percentage of the infill as well. So adding e.g. one more wall can often save you from printing any infill and you'll end up with a cleaner and even more rigid print.  </li> <li>You can also take advantage of the feature \"adaptive layer height\". However, when doing so, keep an eye on the settings as you might reach the maximum flowrate (= limit) or even try to go beyond it. There are online calculators you can use where you type in the layer height, line width and printing speed and then you'll have the according flowrate calculated.  </li> <li>There's a 'physical' limitation to what's possible in terms of maximum flowrate and even the thermal conductivity of the filament itself. So don't expect to successfully use a 1mm nozzle at 300mm/s printing speed  printing huge models with super long layer lines from regular PLA - that most likely won't work out. There are a few things one could do when trying to really reach or even go beyond the limits, like using a Volcano CHT nozzle, using specific HighSpeed-filament and so on.  </li> <li>I personally use plated copper heater blocks at my printers, even tho I'm not going for the highest possible speed. Imho it made a difference due to the increased thermal mass of the heavy copper block vs the aluminum block.   </li> <li>Depending on what speeds should be reached and how big the nozzle will be in the end, it might be good/useful to also use a more powerful heater cartridge when already changing the heater block to a plated copper one. This shouldn't be necessary for the typical user tho as the stock one is 60W and that's usually plenty enough, but just in case one really wants to push the limits, it might be good to have an extra 10W or so and use a 70W heater instead.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/printhead/#spare-nozzles","title":"Spare Nozzles","text":"<p>If you need to replace the nozzle, you either have to buy spare part nozzles directly from Anycubic or find a 3rd party seller who sells these specific nozzles.

Referring to the manufacturers, the coating might be harmed when doing so.  </p> Cleaning The Nozzle <ul> <li>For cleaning the nozzle and getting rid of excessive filament during the printing process or right before printing starts as the extruder is heating up, you can use a long and thin wooden stick like a skewer. A wooden toothpick also works fine - just make sure you don't burn yourself as it may be a bit short. I personally use these long pipe cleaners which have this kinda cotton stuff all around them. It doesn't melt when touching the hot nozzle and filament sticks great to it.  </li> <li>Before and after each print I recommend to wipe away the melted filament at the nozzle with a 'cotton' pipe cleaner, a paper towel or a cloth - but don't burn yourself! This procedure keeps the nozzle clean and the rest of the filament won't burn black onto the brass which makes it hard to remove later.   </li> <li>If the nozzle is already too smeared and has too much filament burnt onto the surface to be cleaned with a paper towel, you can use a small brass brush. Be careful though to not harm the tip of the nozzle by scrubbing too hard across it! Be careful to not touch any wires or contacts during brushing at it may cause a shortcut and blow off your mainboard! So I'd suggest you heat up the nozzle and then turn off the printer before starting to brush.  </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged, using a needle with the correct diameter to stick it into the hot nozzle for cleaning it sometimes works. Just stick in in the heatened up nozzle and poke around. Be careful to not harm the tip of the nozzle though!  </li> <li>You can also use certain filament which is made for cleaning. You load it and let it run through. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged and therefore the cleaning filament can't run through, you could also try to do a \"cold pull\". To do so you heat up the nozzle to about 220\u00b0C, load the cleaning filament and manually push it through a bit. Then let the nozzle cool down to about 90-100\u00b0C and rip out the filament. You may have to repeat this procedure a few times until the cleaning filament can run through again. However, be careful not to rip off the filament by doing the cold pull as you then definitely have to disassemble the hotend. Attention: don't do cold pulls when using any kind of coated nozzles! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! The manufacturers say that it might harm the coating of the inside of the nozzle! </li> <li>If you still encounter problems with the flow of the filament though or if you even can't load new filament, most likely the little PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak is clogged. Scroll down to the \"Disassembling\" section where you'll find a little guide about how to get it out and clean it.  </li> <li>If you took out the nozzle from the heater block and can't get it clean, heat it up with a hot air gun. Then you can poke out the soft filament. You can also try to put it in acetone and let it sit there - the longer the better (I'd say minimum 24hrs). This method works especially great with ABS as that just dissolves, but it also works at least a bit with other types of filament like PLA (although not as good as with ABS at all) and makes it a bit softer. Then you can try to poke the filament out. This also works with the heater block and the heatbreak if you want to clean them also.

Due to the sudden decrease of temperature the metal of the nozzle will contract a tiny bit which may result in being able to unscrew it.  </li> <li>For installing the new nozzle, screw it in and turn it back about one rotation once you feel it hits the heatbreak. I personally do this after everything cooled down until it's safe to touch because then I can screw in the nozzle by hand and therefore I can feel right at the start if it doesn't sit correctly.</li> <li>Check if you didn't harm any wires! </li> <li>If everything is fine, power up the printer and heat up the extruder again. Most nozzle manufacturers say that you should heat it up to about 250\u00b0C, but that might already harm the PTFE tube. So go with 230-240\u00b0.  </li> <li>Then carefully tighten up the nozzle, but don't overtighten it though. However, you need to make sure that it's tight enough (about 1.5NM) and that it really touches the heatbreak! There shouldn't be any gap between the heatbreak and the nozzle inside of the heater block!  </li> <li>Don't get irritated by the fact that there's a little gap between the head of the nozzle and the heater block oncce you installed everything correctly - that's totally fine and it's supposed to be like that as the following picture shows.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/printhead/#part-cooling-fan","title":"Part Cooling Fan","text":"<p>The part cooling fan is a 24V, 0.2A, 50x50x20mm blower, model \"Coolcox BF5020H24S\".  </p> <p>According to the specifications of the manufacturer, the bearing type of this fan is a sleeve bearing.

I'll mostly list parts which aren't that expensive and pretty much known to fail sooner or later. Some of them count as consumables (like nozzles or v-slot wheels for example) and I highly recommend to have at least one or two items of them on stock, others are parts which are nice to have to be on the safe side if anything breaks.    </p> <p>However, it does make sense to check whether it's cheaper to get certain parts on their own or to buy a complete spare part. As an example I'd mention the parts of the printhead here. If you'll get the fans, the thermistor, cartridge heater, heater block, hotend etc. as individual parts it most likely makes more sense to get yourself a complete new printhead as a spare part right away. Of course you still should get nozzles and silicone socks anyway, but if you'd have to pay pretty much the same or even more for some individual parts as for a complete printhead, why should you buy individual parts then? Remember that the whole printhead also includes the feeder gear, the plastic cover, the metal plate, the stepper motor and so on. Anyway - even though it most likely makes more sense to buy a complete printhead to have all the parts stocked, I'll list the imho most important parts from that device also individually.  </p> <p>Consumables which you'll definitely need (sooner or later):  </p> <ul> <li>Nozzle</li> <li>PTFE tube (Neo) / bowden tube plus couplings (Go)</li> <li>Silicone sock</li> <li>V-slot wheel</li> <li>Anti-backlash nut</li> </ul> <p>Good to have because they will most likely fail when you really need the printer to work:  </p> <ul> <li>Thermistor</li> <li>Cartridge heater</li> <li>Heater block </li> <li>Heatbreak </li> <li>Hotend</li> <li>Belts</li> <li>Heatsink fan / hotend fan</li> <li>Part cooler fan</li> <li>Part cooler fan duct (I'd recommend to print a better one than the stock one actually)</li> </ul> <p>Of course you can also stock motors, a lead screw, a mainboard, a power supply unit, a control unit and so on, but in case something like that breaks you might also have other, more severe problems.

Sometimes you have more success to find a specific part at Anycubic's store at AliExpress rather than at their shop website though.    </p> <p>There are also many vendors who sell compatible or even original spare parts, so just do a bit of a research. </p> <p>Also many parts from third party manufacturers can be used as most of the parts are common components of these kinds of machines.   So if you're looking for parts like v-slot wheels, belts, anti-backlash nuts or even a new lead screw or motor for example, keep in mind that those aren't 'specific' parts most of the time - they're pretty much regular components.  Have a look at the spare part you need, read the specific section here about the part and if that's not enough, do a little research if it really is something 'special' that pretty much only Anycubic or authorized sellers are offering (like the mainboard), or if that's a 'regular' component and therefore could be found easily.  </p> <p> </p>"}]}
